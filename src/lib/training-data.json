        "content": "A Change In Perspective\nYesterday I shared an insight I had with a friend. He’s a fellow business owner. When I told him about the epiphany of shifting my perspective from one of obtaining clients versus building partnerships he was awestruck. He immediately got the concept. He affirmed or confirmed that he agreed with my newly found perspective. He also shared he’d been doing something along the same lines. He also shared his process of migrating to more of the model I was setting up and moving from a traditional model to one that’s a bit more untraditional. \nAs I’m typing this another thought occurred. What rule is it that says I can’t do both? I can’t recall any. I can do both. I can build it out in a more traditional manner and cultivate a partnership model as well. In the traditional business terms we say joint ventures. In the joint venture there’s still a partnership. It creates a mutually beneficial relationship between two parties. Successful joint ventures or partnerships usually enhance the capabilities of each involved and deliver more than either expected. \nThe conversation with another business owner and like minded person yesterday ws far different than it was with another person. Another person I’d run my concept past found several reasons it wouldn’t work, why they wouldn’t participate, and my personal flaws, some true, as a reason for declining participation. Just like yesterday, I listened intently, repeated what they said to make sure I understood them correctly, and thanked them for their input. \nThe reason for both stories is the same - some will agree and see your vision and others will not. Some will think of ways you can and will succeed and others will not. There is value in both perspectives. The ones telling you things will work can act as confirmation for your current thoughts or plan of action. The ones disagreeing can act as sounding boards offering you perspectives you haven’t encountered. \nBoth perspectives can provide value to you. The people that tell you that you're a genius or brilliant or so talented or of the many compliments they rain down on you have value. The people that tell you it’s a stupid idea, it’s too risky, it’ll never work, or it’s foolhardy provide value as well. The question to ask, or a variation of the question to ask would be, “What makes you think about it that way?” If you shut up and listen, they will tell you. Then you listen intently, repeat back what they said to make sure you heard them correctly, and thank them for their perspective.\nOne of the Four Agreements is “Don’t Take Things Personally.” It’s less challenging with positives than negatives, but it’s true in either situation. A slight change in perspective is all that’s needed. I can be grateful someone took the time to share their insights. Whether I agree or disagree is irrelevant, the thing to appreciate is their time and their insight.\nToday, Thursday, June 20, 2024, I am grateful that:\nPeople are willing to share their perspectives. It’s geat to have those willing to invest their time and insights on someone else. \nI have people in my circle I can share my perspective with. They may agree of have different views than my own, but they are willing to attentively listen and when asked offered their opinions and points of view.\nI’ve got a bit of a lull in the work week. It’s not planned, but while I’m waiting for a few other things to happen, I’ve got a bit of a respite. I’m using to time to dissect and reconstruct my current strategy and also formulate different tactics to accomplish the strategy. They may are may not work, but it will be well thought out.\nDo you see the benefits of others perspectives?\nDo you take them personally?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "content": "A Couple Of Lessons Learned\nFor a couple of weeks I haven’t written. I’ve been in a small “funk” and just haven’t been willing to document the sadness. I have in the past, but this episode I chose not to do so. Makes me think of the lessons I haven’t written down that are lost with time and bad recollection of events.\nEarlier today I left my building to do a small errands. I greeted a guy on the street in the local dialect and he replied in Spanish. I asked if he was Filipino and he kept replying in Spanish. I haven’t spoken Spanish in years and was too good at it back then, so it’s even worse now, but we did have a brief conversation. During our talk, I discovered he was in need. I told him I had to take care of something and would be back momentarily. He waited and when I returned a few minutes later we continued our talk.\nHe was stranded in Cebu City, trying to get back to Manila. He was here on a work visa and his ATM wasn’t working. I let him know I didn’t have much but would help as best as I was able. I went upstairs to my condo and made a couple of calls. One guy didn’t answer and the other said no. I helped with what I could spare, which seemed inadequate, and we both parted ways.\nThe episode didn’t sit well with me so I reached out to one of the guys I’ve befriended and ran it past him. As he was going over a few things, some lessons were revealed.\nOne was to pay attention to my inner voice. When I’m compelled to act or not act, listen and obey. Another lesson was some occasions will be bigger than what I can do alone. I may need to ask others for assistance. Some will render aide, others will not. Whether they help or not is not my concern, my concern and my part is asking for help when needed. A third lesson as I’ve been typing is we aren’t all compelled for the same reasons or by the same things. Just because I was compelled to assist a stranger doesn’t mean or obligate others to help. That’s between them and their Creator, the same as it is for myself.\nI hadn’t written this morning. I hadn’t written for any mornings over the last few weeks. I’ve been stalled out. I’d like to be able to say I’ve grown complacent or the lists had become mechanical in nature, but the truth of the matter is I didn’t feel compelled to write. \nI’ve been in need of more assistance. I’ve been reluctant to ask. I’ve been doing the research. I’ve been planning. I’ve crunched and re-crunched the numbers and they are accurate. It’s abundantly clear that I perform better when I’m under no financial pressure. I require a bit of a reprieve to fulfill my mission. I will require the assistance of others. I will ask. Some will say yes. Others will say no. My part is to ask. The answers can not come if the question is never presented.\nToday, Wednesday, September 25, 2024, I am grateful that:"

        "content": "A Few Words\nThis morning has been filled with making calls to the states. I’d been having to get some banking things squared away, but have to do those during banking hours in America. Two calls were needed and the second was quite different. \nI won’t mention the young lady’s name, but we shared a few common interests. She’s currently in the Financial Services industry and I’d left a decade before. She is working on the banking side of the organization because she’d failed an industry exam. By a couple of points, she failed. She sounded defeated and discouraged and I could hear it in her voice. \nI shared a bit about me studying for the Series 7 and the Series 66. I also shared about the industry, a couple more certifications that were open once she passed the exam, and the opportunities that would unfold after passing the test. She sounded intrigued a bit, but also skeptical. As I continued, she sounded more encouraged and hopeful. She ended up sounding enthusiastic about studying and setting a date for the test. I told her, “You are capable. If you weren’t, they would not have hired you in the first place.” \nShe’s working at one of the finest, most reputable firms in the industry. I’d applied several times and never got an interview. My applications were submitted when I was still in the industry with active licenses in good standing. I let her know that part too. I told her I didn’t know their screening criteria, but it must be rigid cause she got in the door and hired and I was on the outside looking in. \nShe offered her gratitude for my words and we ended our call. I don’t know if our conversation will make a “positive and lasting” impact, but I hope it will. I don’t know if she’ll pass her exams, but I hope she will. I don’t know if we’ll ever speak again and it doesn’t matter. What matters most is I did my part. I offered a few words. Uplifting, positive, and encouraging words. Those words may fall on deaf ears and she could have been patronizing me and my efforts. Or, those words may be the ones to push her over a hurdle and get her where she needs to go.\nToday, Tuesday, June 18, 2024, I am grateful that:\n I completed one project. It was a tough bit of formulas, but the spreadsheet is finished. \nI got two banking issues resolved. Money is essential for living and without access to mine, well it’s been tough.\nMoe and I spoke and my new place will be ready when I’m ready. Yep, found a new place to live, in my budget. It’s back in the city and close to lots of places I’m familiar with. \nDo you take time to offer a few words of encouragement?\nDo you say what needs to be said?\nAre you candid enough to deliver a message even if it’ll hurt someone’s feelings?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "A Slight Adjustment",
        "content": "A Slight Adjustment\nAbout twenty years ago, a friend of mine invited me to go flying with him and I accepted. He’d been asking for years prior, but for whatever reason, I finally accepted. We met at the airport and I shadowed him as he did his preflight routine. I walked behind him quietly, not say much, but I did ask the occasional question. After we entered the plane and took off, things became a bit interesting. I’d never flown privately, only commercial, and in my mind, I thought once we were airborne the hard part was over. I could not have been more wrong.\nDuring our entire flight, Gene made constant adjustments. He kept moving one knob, then another dial, scanning the horizon, then doing the knobs and dials again. I sat in the cockpit quietly observing and held my questions until we were safely on the ground again. While we walked around after landing, I probed about the knobs and dials and whatnot. He explained that although in-flight, adjustments were needed. One adjustment for trim, another for something else, he kept explaining. As I type this today, I think of how it relates to so many aspects of life. \nI’m currently making slight adjustments. This year has unfolded as I’d planned so far. Two of the first three months spent recovering from a motorcycle accident is an adjustment. Hiring a domestic helper for daily tasks is a slight adjustment. Finding a physical therapist is a slight adjustment. Creating a go fund me fundraiser and being dependent on the charity of others is a slight adjustments. This is just in 2024. My life, and I’m sure yours too, is littered with adjustments. We humans adapt. I’ve adapted to my current state and when it changes again, I’ll make another adjustment. I’m certain others will as well.\nToday, Friday, April 12, 2024, I am grateful that:\nVeronica sent me a message a moment ago and reminded me that tomorrow is my brother’s birthday. I don’t typically write on the weekends so I could have missed it. It’s also great I’ve had a little influence one her as she’s writing her version of a gratitude list now.\nHerb and I had our weekly conversation. As always, he offered some valuable insights. One in particular will be used today as I prepare for a presentation in a few hours. \nThe story about flying with Gene came to mind earlier. I hadn’t thought of him or that flight in years. It was great hanging with him in a different environment. He enjoyed flying and I’m grateful he shared that part of himself with so many people.\nAre you willing to make slight adjustments?\nAre you aware of the adjustments when you make them?\nCan you see th benefits from the adjustments you’ve made?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "content": "Abundance Mindset\nIn the past, and some days currently, I start to tell myself there isn’t enough. I begin to think that I can’t make ends meet. I may, at times, begin to think I’m not able or smart enough to do something. I have all these negative thoughts. They seem true when I know they’re not. It seems as if I don’t have enough to get things done. It seems as if I'm not smart enough to do something. It seems that way, but the truth is, my mind is playing tricks on me. I’m more than able. I’m more than capable. I have plenty. What I lack, cause there are deficiencies, leaps towards me and becomes available. \n“As A Man Thinketh” talks about it. The Bible talks about it. Wise men and women have discussed it for centuries. You can do what countless others have done and change your thoughts. You are enough. You have plenty. Opportunities find you. Money finds you. Love finds you. You are worthy. You are capable. You are enough. All of these affirming statements and many more lay a foundation upon which your greatness will be displayed. \nI’ve been struggling with getting things done this week. It’s only Wednesday and I feel as if I’m behind. Here’s the funny thing, my feelings are not true. I’ve accomplished lots of things on my list. I printed out a list of items to accomplish this month and as I look at the list now, seven items are finished with four completed yesterday. Doesn’t stop how I was “feeling” or what I was “thinking.” Our thoughts and feelings can be deceptive. They can be inaccurate. But, we are in complete and total control over them. \nI choose to live in an abundant mindset. I choose to believe that if I am lacking in some area, whatever I need exists and will find me. I must not yield. I must not stop. I must keep moving forward at my current pace, or faster, so whatever is headed my way arrives right on time. When I slow down, when I quit, when I stop, I disrupt the timing. It’s not like I do these things intentionally, but they happen. I then have to start again, moving even faster, and intersect with them at a later point. \nTruth be told, that may all be false and totally inaccurate. But I think not. I think it is and so it is. We are what we think we are. Interestingly enough, we don’t get judged on our thoughts. We’re judged on our actions. Our thoughts do dictate our actions, so we are indirectly judged on our thoughts. Think about that for a second. Most sane people think before they act. If that’s true, acting without thinking is insane. It’s unreasonable. \nThink and you will be. Act as you think. \nToday, Wednesday, August 21, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI sent over the docs to Herb. It’s been over a month with this first project. Speaking once a week plus me learning something new took longer than expected, but that part is finished.\nMy mindset is changing again. I’m growing in my conviction. I’m growing in how to implement and succeed in what’s really important on this journey. Others find this sooner, but it’s takes what it takes. \nOne by one tasks are getting done. I enjoy having a list now more than in my past. I haven’t done list is years and it’s something that’s proving beneficial right now. That may change, but for now, I’ll continue with my lists, scratch this off when completed, and keep them taped to the wall as a reminder that what I’m doing and how I feel about what I’m doing may differ at times. \nDo you have plenty?\nDo you behave as if you have plenty?\nIf not, how can you start? What’s one thing you can do today?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "Alternative Answers or Solutions",
        "content": "Alternative Answers or Solutions\nLast week I started working on a project with a bit of zest and vigor. I’d purchased access to a tool to assist in my endeavors. The tools is subscription based and has a monthly usage limit, which I had no idea of how much I could do or would accomplish using the tool. Four or five days into the subscription, I’ve exhausted the entire month’s allotment. I’d like to say I’m disappointed, because I am, but I’m more impressed that I finished what I did so quickly. \nBased on my usage, the plans they offer, and the time to find a viable alternative, it looks like a week worth of work, at that rate, is all I’ll get done with this provider. There are alternatives. Similar service providers exist and I’ll begin using them as well. There’s also the proprietary solution of building a system for our company. I’d explored both alternatives before making my current decision. I’ll not need to research again as my info is less than a month old. The challenge is time. I set a deadline and goal for three days from today. I’m forty percent complete and building out an alternative will more than likely cause me to miss my deadline. I’ll walk around a bit, drink some coffee, and come back with a decision in a few.\nAfter thinking about it for a bit this morning, I’ve made a decision. I’ll work on a proprietary system. I can complete it in phases. I can complete a working model today, as compared to my previous estimations of months. It won't be ideal, but it’ll be enough to get started and keep going. I’m familiar enough with three of the five systems needed to make the first stage viable. If, at the end of today, it’s not working, I’ll pay for another service provider. There’s no need to keep thinking and contemplating on this issue, I can quickly implement an alternative and test it. This solution isn’t ideal, but it’s workable and today, that’s what I need, something that’s workable.\nToday, Monday, July 29, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI’ve been disciplined enough to set and maintain a routine. I deviated this morning and the majority of the day is gone. I answered the phone, made a call, and did some impromptu writing. All done for friends, but I must be more disciplined.\nI got a chance to meet and help Elliott get settled into the city. We met while I was outside smoking. He’s from near my place in Texas and it was repayment of a debt I owe to those that helped me get settled.\nThere are a few other men, on similar paths, but a bit further along in their journey in the building. It’s great to tap into the experience of others. Opinions are cool, but experience is rare and quite valuable.\nHow do you find alternatives?\nWhat’s the last solution you implemented that wasn’t part of the original plan?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "Another Delay",
        "content": "Another Delay\nFor the last hour, I’ve been trying to sign in to this account. I haven’t worked in exactly two months. My hiatus was not planned. I nearly died. Not to sound too dramatic or overstate the accident, but simply stating the facts. At roughly 5 a.m. on February the first, I was riding on the back of a motorcycle. It’s a common means of transportation here in the Philippines. We were about to turn left and head home when a small cargo truck ran into us from behind. Be mindful, I don’t remember any of the incident. I’m only stating what I saw from the security camera footage.\nA second delay for signing in is not that big of a deal. By all accounts and according to everyone that’s seen the video, I should have died in the accident. I’ll contemplate whether to post it to the blog or on Youtube, but for now the answer is no. Five broken ribs, a broken right arm, head contusion, and various scraps and scratches had me hospitalized for three weeks. I’ve also been recovering at home for slightly more than a month. But with today being the start of a new month, I figured it can be the start of a new effort to redefine, recommit, and work towards achieving my purpose.\nSo yeah, an hour-long delay signing in hasn’t stressed me out. The two month delay is an entirely different story. This forced respite has been a time of thankfulness, reflection, and rebirth. My gratitude list will continue. I’ve recommitted and will place my plan of action in writing. Most importantly, after watching the accident video, I’m convinced the old me is dead. \nMy hope is you don’t have to experience something as drastic as I to get to that point in your life. I’m convinced, now more than ever, that in order to get where we’re intended or destined to go, our previous selves must die. As the week goes on, I’ll write more about this particular lesson. I’ll even explain how it’s acted as an accelerant to things I’ve been contemplating, but not acted upon or completed for well over a year. I’ll also pen how relationships saved my life. Living in a foreign country, with no children, wife, or girlfriend and suffering a life threatening accident and surviving is no small feat. It was all accomplished, the most vital parts as I lay unconscious. More on that another time.\nToday, Monday, April 1, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI am alive. I can’t recall ever writing those words before. I think them often, but the visual of the impact of the truck has drastically changed my perspective. \nThe seeds I’d sewn are ripe for harvest. I’d written about my harvest before and thought this harvest was the actual endgame. After reflection, it seems as if this harvest will lay the foundation for an abundant harvest, the likes most have never seen and only a small few have experienced.\nFear, in its various forms, has left. Fear of success, failure, the spotlight, recognition and the like, all have fallen or are falling away, as I step into the servant He has graced me to become. \nAre you able to remain steadfast in your course?\nHow resolute are you in pursuing His purpose for you?\nWhat can you do today to move closer to your purpose?\nWhat will completing that one action feel like?\nBe Greater!!!\nAbe"

        "title": "Application Is Essential",
        "content": "Application Is Essential\nEssential is defined as extremely important or absolutely necessary. While application is the action of putting something into operation. The reason for putting forth these definitions first is hopes of dispelling some half truths we’ve all believed. “Knowledge is power” comes to mind this morning. We’ve probably heard this old adage as it’s been around since 1597 and is attributed to Sir Francis Bacon. \nCenturies ago we didn’t have the internet. Centuries ago we didn’t have smartphones. During those times we couldn't pick up our phone and search the entirety of human knowledge within seconds. It may have been true then, but today, I would pose it’s quite different. Today I would propose that we all have knowledge. If we all have knowledge and knowledge is power, then none of us do. \nIn my experience it has nothing to do with what you know. My knowledge avails me little to nothing if not applied. If I were a Financial Advisor, which I was, and didn’t put the knowledge into operation, the knowledge was not power. The knowledge availed me little to nothing without its application. Here’s an example that’s not so personal. We all probably know how to tie our shoes, but if we don’t apply that knowledge we’d be walking around in tennis shoes with untied laces.\nIt is extremely important to put our knowledge into operation. It’s essential or vital or paramount. All the knowledge in the libraries around the planet mean nothing if not applied. Now we can perform a simple search with an active internet connection and get what we’re looking for. However, without applying what we know, the knowledge isn’t power. It just exist in our minds and that’s about it.\nThink about your knowledge. What skills and traits you possess. Those skills, that knowledge that’s specialized in nature. Those things that could be valuable to someone else. To another person, another business or organization that if applied by you, would be valuable to them. \nToday, Wednesday, June 5, 2024, I am grateful that:\nGary and I spoke earlier. It’s his birthday. I knew it was in June, but couldn’t remember the day. So I kept calling until we spoke and he told me today. Family by choice, not by blood is still family, in my humble opinion.\nI’ve been learning a new platform. It’ll allow me to serve more people in a shorter amount of time. That’s leverage. That’s an accelerant. That’s the kind of thing I’ll need to discover, learn, and apply moving forward.\nI’m able to see the light at the end of the tunnel so to speak. I’m nearing the completion of assemblage of this puzzle. It’ll lay the foundation for the next few years and without a proper foundation an edifice can not stand long. I can see how so many of the pieces fit together to form my base and from this base of operations the remainder of the plan springs forth to serve my fellows.\nAssess your specialized knowledge. Write down those things you posses that you do exceptional well. \nNow review your list. If it’s short, great. If it’s extensive, that’s great too. The list is what’s important, not the length. \nIf your list is empty, write a list of things you really enjoy doing. Now, think of how you can learn a specialized skill around what you enjoy and write that down.\nAbe, \nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "Applying What You Know",
        "content": "Applying What You Know\nThis week I’ve written about discipline and knowing the rules. Over the years people, mostly friends, some family, have asked why I keep going? Some have asked what will it take for me to stick with one job? Others ask how is it that I’m happy considering all I’ve gone through? Applying what I’ve learned or what I know to what I’m going through at the moment is one way to get through tough times.\nHerb and I spoke yesterday and during our conversation the differences in generations came up. We spoke about responsibility, being accountable, and taking initiative, but resolve or resilience could have easily fit into our dialogue. We hve evolve to either seek pleasure or avoid pain as Tony Robbins puts it and I agree. Society today has softened our human experience. In school only the top three spots in a competition received any type of award when I attended. Today and for years now as I understand it, everyone gets recognized and awarded a participation trophy. Life is quite the opposite.\nWhen I was an employee, I was not recognized for showing up on time or doing my job. I was not sent a trophy when I paid my rent or electric bill on time. I did suffer the consequences of not paying a bill with decreased credit scores or no electricity though. A night or two without electricity taught me to pay my bills on time.There are lessons to be learned in my failures, but when we are insulated from failure and praised for simply showing up, we are deprived of those lessons.\nFalling down is the simplest way to learn how to get up. Impact with the ground isn’t pleasant, but that’s part of the consequences. Recall the definition of discipline, the practice of training people to obey rules or a code of behavior, using punishment to correct disobedience. The punishment was the ground impact as a consequence for not following the code for walking. A benefit is learning how to get up and keep walking by following the rules for walking. If I don’t follow the rules of my employer, I will be terminated as an employee. If I don’t follow the rules of traffic, I will be issued traffic citations or involved in traffic accidents. \nEach situation has its own rewards and consequences. Application of life’s lessons are vital. A fool is doomed to repeat the past. If I’m still suffering the consequences for not following the rules of behavior after one or two failed attempts, it’s quite possible my punishment wasn’t severe enough to change my behavior. I’ve had that experience also and when it gets more severe, it’s a game changer. \nApplying what I’ve learned and what others have learned lessens the amount of failures I have to suffer. Some suffer more than others. “A hard head makes for a soft behind” is a phrase my Mom would state when I misbehaved as a child. One of many such phrases have stuck over the years and are just as true today as they were when she uttered them all those years ago. \nThere may be ways to insulate yourself from all consequences. The flip side of the same coin is softness. Instead pf building your resilience muscle, it atrophies and dies. \nToday, Friday, May 3, 2024, I am grateful that:\nRecalling my history helps dictate my present. I do not living a reaction based life, most times. I am able to evaluate current situations, apply what I’ve learned, and make today’s decisions based on the benefits or consequences I’ve experienced.\nI finally got a community going. It’s not complete, but it’s started. I’ve got videos and more pics to upload along with tons of contect. However, two days ago I could not have even said that. So it’s begun and hoping my lessons will aid others on their journey.\nHerb and I got a chance to talk. He’s been recovering from an illness and we didn’t talk last week. Being able to talk yesterday was good for us both. \nMoe called this morning. He let me know he’d arrived back to Cebu safely last night. He’d been stateside for some family things and it was great to catch up for a bit. In some instances, interruption of my morning routine are acceptable.\nList two or three lessons you’ve learned.\nHow do those lessons dictate your behavior today.\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "content": "Back In The Saddle?\nWell, maybe - maybe not. The last few weeks have been incredibly uncomfortable. I’ve been discontent. I’ve been confused. I’ve been irritable. I’ve been absent from the keyboard and not from a lack of discipline standpoint, but rather a “I’m in a mood” standpoint. I hadn’t felt like writing, so I didn’t. \nI don’t feel good or bad about missing the last few weeks. I probably would have had some negative thoughts bouncing around my head years ago about the inconsistency. Today though, I written long enough and consistently enough to know - it’s not about discipline. This absence is merely an absence. \nMost mornings writing helps me sort things out in my mind. Most mornings writing helps me commune with my Creator. Most mornings it’s about a bit of quiet time before a hectic day begins. Over the last few weeks though, that time hasn’t been as important. I diverted my mental energy in another direction. \nMy focus for at least three and possibly as much as six weeks has been launching my newest endeavor. I’d been working towards fulfilling my purpose for several years. My first iteration of my purpose was in 2017, but after a few months this version emerged. It’s remained unchanged, with the exception of two words since that time. I’ve been working towards its fulfillment daily since then. It’s led me to live in two other countries, take on multiple freelance projects, and meet with some great people along the way.\nYou may not know your purpose. It could be that you haven’t set aside time to discover it yet. If you have, then you’ll understand it’s importance. You’ll understand the sleepless nights. You’ll get it when I say “It’s what I’ve got to do.” For those that get it, you know some things seem like a distraction and must be eliminated. For those that don’t, well - that’s ok too.\nSo the title of this list is concluded with a question mark. I don’t know if I’ll keep writing in this intiration. I may, I may not, only time will tell. \nI’ve reached a point where I know the precise first few steps towards accomplishing my mission. These lists may act as a compliment, they may be a hindrance. Should it be the latter, this is me signing off. If it’s the first, glad you’re along to share this part of my journey. \nToday, Tuesday, October 22, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI wrote today. In essence, today is all we have. It’s been a rather uncomfortable few weeks. I don’t particularly enjoy transition periods, but I am aware I’m currently in the mist of one. \nAt some point in the not too distant future, after this transition, I’ll be more akin to the person needed to fulfill my purpose. The road is arduous and unfamiliar, but it’s the path I’m on. I will not relent. I am grateful to have the opportunity. \nI’m willing to do what’s needed. I’m finally at the point that I’ve avoided for weeks. I’m willing to seek out and and accept assistance. I’m unable to go much further without assistance. What is required is beyond my means. I will ask for, find, and be grateful for the help I’m about to receive. \nIs there something you typically do, that you haven’t done is awhile?\nIs there a way to starting doing that thing again?\nWill doing that thing help you accomplish your mission?\nIf so, start doing that thing again today!\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "Back On Guard",
        "content": "Back On Guard\nYears ago, I’d written about guarding what’s sacred. Being vigilant and steadfast towards those things we hold near and dear to our hearts. Those things, we all have some, must be protected. For me it’s the time I take to write these lists. It’s a way to now communicate with people I don’t know. Initially, it was a way to commune with my Creator. It later evolved to a way to stave off my depression. I’ve treated this time of the day as sacred, for the most part. If you have some time like this or some items important to you, I’d suggest you do the same. \nI’ve deviated or fell asleep on guard duty before. Today and yesterday I fell asleep. I answered the phone yesterday and this morning again. I enjoy being available for my friends and family, but I also need to be available for myself. I need to guard what’s sacred. I need to protect the time I’ve discovered helps me be the best version of myself. Yesterday and today I did not do that. Yesterday it was to have a conversation with my brother. This morning it was to speak with a friend visiting the states. Both, in my opinion, were great conversations and worth having. However, I didn’t guard my time and my writing. \nOne of the things I’ve learned from writing these lists in the morning, before I do anything else, is I’ve got clarity of mind. I’ve usually just woken up and had a few sips of coffee. I’ve opened a new document, thought of a title, and put my fingers to the keyboard and started typing. I haven’t done it this morning, but in the recent past, I perused through some of my writings. My topics varied greatly from day to day. I typically didn’t follow a particular theme, unless it was recurring at the time I wrote the lists. That’s still true, for the most part. These lists were never meant to be shared since it was between me and my Creator. It’s slightly different now because I’m writing for an audience that I haven’t even met. \nI’m writing for you or someone you care about and sent this to. I’m writing for the person on a similar journey, but a little bit behind my present location. I’m writing for those struggling with their faith. I’m writing for those struggling with depression. I’m writing for those with doubts about their ability. I’m writing for those wanting something greater and unclear if they are capable or if it’s possible. I’m no longer writing for just me and my needs. \nFor years it’s been about me and what I needed. Now it’s about you, even though we haven’t met. Now it’s about carrying a message of hope. Now it’s about showing what’s possible. Now it’s about proving that some applied faith and discipline really works, and works well. Now it’s about doing those things I thought and dreamt about, but was reluctant for one reason or another to finish. I write for those reasons today. I will never be as effective if I fall asleep on post. I will never be able to deliver this message if I don’t guard what’s sacred. That is unacceptable today. It may change at some point in the future, but today, I’m back on post, back on guard duty, and protecting what’s important. If I don’t, no one else will.\nToday, Thursday, August 1, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI’m remembering what’s important. I fell asleep at the wheel, on post, on guard duty or whatever you want to call it. Now I remember what makes this time so precious and I refuse to allow anyone to disturb it again.\nI made some progress on an alternative solution yesterday. I’d been working on a project for a month and had to find an alternative. The first one wasn’t working, but the second one seems as if it will. I’ll know if it’s viable before noon today and hoping it will be something I can use.\nI’ve got a contract starting tonight and two more interviews later. I’m getting to a spot where contracts and work will start coming in. I don’t really enjoy the work, trading my time for money, but while I’m working on the other project I’ve gotta be able to pay my bills and this will do that.\nI took some action and spoke with a couple of attorneys. They want what I consider excessive fees for their services. A good friend said I was price shopping. I agreed and laughed. Everything seems excessive or expensive when you don’t have the cash.\nAre you willing to guard what’s important?\nWhich things have you taken for granted that you would be better off if you guarded it with more vigor?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "Back On Track",
        "content": "Back On Track\nHad to make a few adjustments towards the end of last week, but I’m back on track today. Up and writing first thing has proven to be the best way to start my days. My morning routine has changed numerous times over the years. From no routine to two or so hours of walking, running, reading and meditation to writing my gratitude lists. This routine I’ve kept the longest. I’m not saying it works the best, but I am saying I’ve done this longer than anything else. In fact, writing is the profession I’ve kept the longest.\nOver my career, I would venture to guess I’ve held over thirty positions. Those jobs have been in at least four different industries. I will eventually sit and account for each industry and each position, but for the sake of momentum and not losing my train of thought, those numbers will suffice. I’ve written full time for longer than any other profession. \nWriting feels natural. It still requires practice. It requires patience. It requires me to practice and work on perfecting my craft. The ability to deliver compelling, engaging, and concise messages may indeed be a gift for some, but I have to work at it. These lists are the only things I put out unedited. Every other piece of content is put through a rewrite process that takes time. I write my list and I’m typically finished in less than 30 minutes. I had no intention of putting these other for other people to read, but if it helps someone else, I’m guessing they’ll be no harm in attempting to help. Time will tell. \nDistractions arise. We, you and I, must remain vigilant. Keeping a watching eye on our overall task, our purpose, is primary. These other things that surface are simply distractions. This morning I’m dealing with plumbing issues. I have a helper since I’m still recovering from my accident and she’s quite capable, but keeps asking me questions. I’m not a plumber and neither is she. I write for a living. After a couple volleys of questions and answers, I said all I wanted to do is write uninterrupted. When and if the plumber arrives, we can address any of his questions then. But trying to answer his questions, over the phone, while interrupting my morning routine, in not acceptable. I must stay on track. I must remain focused. I must do what my Creator built me to do. The other things are relevant, but not as important.\nToday, Monday, April 15, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI got some things done over the weekend. Normal errands and the like would have been impossible a month ago, but today I’m more healed. I could get some tasks finished, without the need of my helper, and that was refreshing. \nI haven’t lost my temper yet. I’m more than frustrated with this plumber situation. My inability to speak the language and the way they handle things is beginning to take its toll this morning. I don’t have the patience to deal with interruptions in my routine. My routine is essential. Some changes have to made and in short order.\nI can envision a means of delivery for my lists. I can also envision more of what needs to be done to complete this phase of fulfilling my purpose. It’s not the entire thing, but part of what will lay the foundation for the rest. I’m under no pressure outwardly, but inside, I’m still feeling as if I’m on borrowed time and must move with a sense of urgency.\nHow do you stay on track?\nHow do you identify you’ve lost focus?\nHow do you assess your progress?\nAbe,1"

        "title": "Back Where I Started",
        "content": "Back Where I Started\nIn November 2018, I bought a one way ticket to Manila. I lived there for about six weeks. My family doctor was living in the country, but in another city. I reached, he invited me to visit, and I’ve been in Cebu City since then. I arrived a couple days after Christmas and stayed in his second bedroom. I soon found my own condo in the same building and lived there for several years. \nI awoke in the same unit this morning. Having lived in several places over the last few years, I’m back where I started. It’s similar to a “checkpoint” in some video games. I didn’t have to start over entirely, ut I went back and lost some progress in the game.\nLife is not a video game. In life we may lose progress, but we get to keep our experience. I’m back at the last checkpoint. I’m back where it all started in this city. I’m back more than six years of experience. When you return to a checkpoint or restore a saved game, you lose all your experience. Life isn’t a video game, we can return to a checkpoint, but keep our experience.\nYears ago, my brother and I had a similar conversation. I was contemplating returning to the Life Insurance business. Having about 15 years of industry experience, my thoughts were the basic things today were seemingly insurmountable challenges when I first started. I may eventually return to the Life Insurance industry, but for now, I am creating. \nLater in the week I’ll write about more and more things. I’ll cover a variety of areas and I’ll share some insights and experiences. For today though, this is my first time writing in well over three months. Possibly longer than that and that’s not an issue. I typically write five days a week and have been doing so for years. Occasionally, these writings become mechanical and I’m simply going through the motions. That happened several months ago. \n“Successful people keep doing the things that made them successful.” Another one of my favorites is “If you stick with the basics, you never have to go back to the basics.” I mention both of these because lists like this first thing in the morning are the basics. These lists are vital to my success. Yet, for over three months I stopped. In that time I’ve had manic and depressive episodes. I’ve been grumpy and unpleasant to be around. I’ve met, befriended, and also alienated people. Men and women alike have fallen prey to the unhinged, ungrateful version of myself. \nReturning to this building, to this unit, to this starting point has already, and will certainly continue to awaken something within. It’s helping me remember my reason for living in the country. It’s begun to help me recall my deep desire to move here initially. It’s also helping me recall that I’m not putting lipstick on a pig and I’m not a failure. \nIn the years of living here, I’ve published three books, have two others outlined and more than likely will be completed by the end of March. I’ve created two transformative self paced development programs. I’ve also created a podcast, a couple of YouTube channels, an innovative play on educational content delivery, and a couple of other things. \nI typically discount my contributions and accomplishments. Not sure why that is, but I consider them past things. I don’t rest on my laurels. I focus on what’s in front and when a project or book or whatever is finished, I’m on to the next thing. I don’t take time to pat myself on the back and relish those accomplishments. I may need to improve in that area, but for now, acknowledgement is enough.\nToday, Wednesday, February 12, 2025, I am grateful that:\nMy move is basically complete. Need to get organized in the new place, but I’m out of the old. Less stress, smaller expenses, and bigger possibilities. It may be none of those things in six months, but that’s what it is today. \nThere’s comfort and familiarity with these lists. Even after the prolonged absence, writing offers comfort, clarity, and solitude. \nI slept well last night. Soreness from the accident, from lifting and moving, and being older and out of shape all played a part in my pain so resing well and comfortably was most welcomed. \nWhat’s your reset button?\nHave you had to hit it recently?\nDo you think you may need to soon?\nShould you hit the button, how would your current experience help?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "content": "Be Decisive\nDecisive comes from decide. The cide of decide means to cutoff. A couple other meanings are “to decide” or “to determine” which means simply this - figure out what you’re going to do and do that thing. \nCortez, the famed explorer, arrived in Mexico in 1519 to conquer the Aztecs. The story goes that when he arrived with a couple hundred men, he immediately ordered his troops to burn their boots. I would suspect Cortez made a decision before leaving and many more along the way. But the most pronounced decision of the Spanish explorer, the one that resounds centuries after being made, was instructing his men to burn the boats. \nHe was decisive. He “determined” his course of action and the actions of his men. He “cut off” any means of retreat. I bought a one way ticket to the Philippines. I decided to stay until the job was done. I was decisive. I cut off any means of retreat. I’ve been incredibly uncomfortable since at least 2020. For more than four years, I’ve lived with a slight feeling of irritability. I’ve lived in another country for over five years, having known only one person in the country. \n“If you don’t know where you’re going, how will you know when you get there?” Most people spend more time planning their vacations than their careers. Defining your legacy, defining how you will be remembered, enhancing your skills, fulfilling your purpose, and so many other items require the ability to be decisive. \nMake a decision. Be decisive. Dig in your heels and decide. Do not yield. Do not change course. Rest on your resolve. It will require being uncomfortable. It’s growth! You will not be ready for the growth and it will be different. You have more within you than you know. You are stronger and more determined than you now. You are destined for remarkable things. You MUST believe in yourself and your decision. Cut off all distractions. Determine what you desire and move with certainty. Burn the boat of mediocrity, choose to live abundantly. Determine your direction. Your best plan B is to make plan A work. \nToday, Wednesday, January 17, 2024, I am grateful that:\nVictoria and I got a chance to speak. This endeavor may prove fruitful, but it seems as if it’ll take a bit more time than I’d like. Time to make another decision.\nAll my needs are met today. Tomorrow looks pretty bleak, but today is covered. Projecting what will happen tomorrow, next week, or even further away could and has led to stressful min sets. I’m doing my best to not take that approach. \nI’ll get my website setup this week. I’ve got over two weeks of blogs for this year and several hundred more from about the last four or five years. I’ve gotta get those up and on the site. It’ll be a big task, but I’m sure I can get it done before the end of the month.\nWhen was the last time you were decisive?\nWhen will you be decisive again?\nWhat will you decide?\nWill you “burn the boat?”\nAbe,\n Be Greater!!!"

        "title": "Be Like The Bajau",
        "content": "Be Like The Bajau\nAs some of you know, I’ve been living in the Philippines for several years. It’s a different culture than America and also Brazil. I’m certain its traits are unique just like many other places on the planet. There’s a nomadic, sea dwelling tribe called the bajau. They’ve adapted to living off of their environment which is mostly water. Most can hold their breath in excess of five minutes. This is exceptional when compared to the fact that most people range from a few seconds to around three minutes. However, with their unique skill set some have chosen another path.\nThere’s a group of these nomads that live off of the charity of strangers. These Bajau don’t dwell and thrive in an environment with water. They don’t surround themselves with water and fish and scavenge from the ocean as other members of their tribe. These nomads spend hours upon hours everyday asking for handouts. They are beggars. I’ve seen them over the years and they typically congregate around the city in high traffic areas. When the light is red, they approach your car or taxi asking for money. They’ll often do so when you’re walking as well. \nBeing a nomadic people, they may like wandering around different parts of the city. They may do so on an unconscious level, never knowing the reason. I’ve spoken with several of the locals and they’ve explained it over the years. What’s interesting is that in the last few weeks since living in my new place, I’ve noticed they aren’t so nomadic at all. In fact, about eight to twelve of them live close to my condo. I’ve been waking up early these days and while outside drinking my morning coffee, I’ve noticed them walking to one of the busiest intersections in the city. \nThe first time I noticed it, I thought it was peculiar. But after the second and third mornings in a row, I understood. These Bajau are doing what I’d done. They were living part of my past, part of my history, and maybe part of your present. Let me explain. The Bajau have a natural gift, but chose to either ignore or deny its existence. I’ve been granted several gifts and chose to ignore or deny them as well. You may relate and you may not, but there may very well be things you take for granted that friends, family, and colleagues are envious of your ability to do those things. \nYour talent, your gifts are an extension of you and who you are. For the Bajau, it’s their ability to hold their breath for an extended period of time. For you, it could be your ability to see relationships and correlations. Perhaps it’s an ability mathematically or organizationally. It could be spatial reasoning or any other number of gifts. If all these sound peculiar and you’re uncertain what your gifts are or you’re working in a field that doesn’t appreciate or acknowledge your gifts, you might be like the Bajau. \nWe’ve got a finite amount of time on the planet. In the game of life, using your gifts lessens the burdens of life. The nomadic Bajau in the city make a choice to ignore and deny their natural gifts or genius which is partly defined as exceptional natural ability. You and I possess something similar and if we’re not using it consistently, we are making our journey more arduous than necessary. Years ago I set aside time to rediscover my genius. I assessed those things I did exceptionally. I would encourage you to do the same. Since that time of discovery, my life has changed in some profound ways. \nI would encourage, better yet, I would beg you to exploit your genius. Exploit means to make full use of and derive benefit from. These Bajau I’ve observed over the last few weeks do not. For years, I did not. If you are not, I would suggest you begin to. My life has changed in ways too numerous to detail here. \nToday, Monday, July 15, 2024, I am grateful that:\nJune and I got a chance to have lunch yesterday. It’s always pleasant to hang out with like minded individuals. \nLynn and I got a chance to hang for a bit a couple of days ago. We’re traversing similar paths. He’s launching his podcast, as am I. He’s concerned with applying his expertise to assist others, as am I. He’s living in another country, in the same building, as am I. \nJames and I went to dinner last night. It was great cause after we ate, we both got a chance to grab some items we needed for our condos. I mean the store was literally about 30 steps aways from the restaurant. \nI’m in this new place. I’ll do what’s needed to stay in this environment with like minded people. I’m most in my element here than other places I’ve lived in the city.\nAre you aware of your genius?\nWhat are they?\nIf you don’t know them, take some time to write down those things you do exceptionally well.\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "Be Nice or Be Polite",
        "content": "Be Nice or Be Polite?\nOver the last few days, I’ve had to change my approach and interactions with people. I’ve typically considered myself nice. I’ve also repeatedly said to myself, “Be nice to everybody” or “I’m nice to everybody” or something along those lines. With a couple of interactions this week I’ve realized one main thing, don’t be nice to everyone - they don’t deserve it.\nIn my opinion and experience, being nice is different from being polite. Being nice not just returns a greeting, but also ask one or two follow up questions. Being nice means I’ll take a second or two and engage in a conversation. Being nice means taking an interest in how that person is doing at that particular moment. Being nice requires a bit more from me than I’m willing to give. Being nice means going out of my way at most times to render aide to those that need it. Being polite is quite different.\nBeing polite is being friendly, but curt. Being polite means is you speak or greet, I respond. Being polite means offering some assistance, but in the form of answering questions not guiding you in that particular direction or accompanying you on a task. Being polite leads to shorter interactions. These interactions are short, sweet, and to the point. \nLast week our building hired another concierge. I’d be nice and not only return her greeting, but also ask about her, how her day was going, and if she was getting comfortable in her new position. That’s being nice as compared to simply returning her greeting and continuing on with my day. A new tourist arrived and chose to extend his visa. He asked how to accomplish this task. I provided the information and went above and beyond by accompanying him to immigration. This typical errand of less than two hours with a 45 minute commute in each direction morphed into over three hours before I ended the trip by walking back to my condo. \nIn each instance, I see the error of my ways. I could have saved myself a bunch of time by being polite and not being nice. Nothing requires me to go above and beyond, yet I frequently do. I’m at a point now that I’m cognizant of the amount of time I have remaining in each day and I refuse to squander any of it. So moving forward, I’ll be polite to everyone, but not nice. I’ll not invest my time into random strangers or friends and colleagues that offer little to no return on my investment. It may seem callous, but life can and has been callous. I must behave accordingly. \nToday, Friday, October 18, 2024, I am grateful that:\nMy domain is registered and so are a couple of social media accounts. It’s a tedious process and I have little patience, but it appears I possess more than I believed in the past.\nMy site’s first iteration is nearly done. I’ve got to tweak some wording and get the videos to play, but it’s up and running. \nMy skool.com community is up also. It’s been a rather productive week. I’ll begin posting to the community also. There won’t be much sleep for me over the next couple of days. My sleep deprivation will help others and for that I’m grateful. \nAre you too nice?\nDo you invest too much time being nice?\nWould being polite serve you better in certain instances?\nHow can you discern which is most appropriate?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "content": "Be The Runt \nToday I started writing a list titled, “Being Authentic” and stopped a few paragraphs in. This thought popped into mind, more than once in the last 24 hours, and I knew I needed to get it out of my head and on paper.\nI’ve been living in the Philippines for over five years now. A group of friends is called a barkada. Most Americans would call it your circle of friends, cronies, your crew, or a number of other terms. I’d propose that you are who you hang out with. I’d noticed that I’m the runt of the litter. I’m the runt in my circle, barkada, or my crew. Of all my friends, I’m the lowest, smallest, undersized, or smaller than average within my circle. \nEvery friend I hang out with is doing better professionally. Every friend I hang out with typically does better romantically, meaning they’ve been married for years, maybe decades. Every friend I hang out with is doing better financially, meaning they save or invest better than I. Each friend performs better in certain areas of their lives. They display a standard to strive for. \n“Comparison is the thief of joy” is often said and it, I believe, is true in most cases. There’s another approach I’ve found useful, yet challenging to explain. The word originates from a meaning to make equal with and there’s the thing. “Comparison is the thief of joy or the ideal of which to strive.” I came up with that on the fly and may change it a bit later, but it’ll do for now. Basically, it’s a matter of perspective. \nI can be unhappy about being the runt. I can think and say I’m not good enough. I can say I don’t have all the things my friends have and therefore I’m unworthy and sad. Or, I can say these people are doing and living exactly how I’d like to. These friends have salaries I’d like. These friends have relationships I’d like. These friends drive cars I’d like to drive. They have clothes, watches, and jewelry I’d like to wear. These friends have serenity, clarity, focus, and determination I’d like to possess. “How can I get from where I am to where you are?” would be the questions to ask of your friends.\nThe difference is perspective. You can allow others doing better than you in certain areas to make you feel less than, or depressed, or you can use them as a standard bearer, a protagonist if you will. The decision is yours to make. I’ve decided for the remainder of my life I’ll be the runt. I’ll always surround myself with friends doing better than I am currently. I’ll do this so I can ask them how can i get from where I am to where you are? That’s the reason since there’s always room for improvement. Always!!!\nToday, Thursday, August 29, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI possess a different perspective. We all filter messages based on our experiences, emotions, and education. All three have provided some insights others may not have and that’s truly a blessing.\nJovy is working today. I’m still not fully recovered from the accident. I despise not being able to fend for myself, but I’m happy I can afford to pay for someone to do some things I’m unable to do at the moment. \nGrady and Stan sent some help today. It’s been a challenge recovering, financially and physically. Mentally I’m guessing I’m strong, but those other areas require some work. When the chips are down, it’s great to have people in your corner.\nAre you the Alpha in your circle?\nAre you willing to be the runt?\nIf so, how can you accomplish that task?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "Being Intentional",
        "content": "Being Intentional\nWhen I first started writing these lists my intent was to stave off my depression. I figured it would be hard to be depressed if I started writing things I was grateful for every morning. That was over a decade ago and I’m still writing. Initially, I’d write these on my bathroom mirror but it’s since evolved into writing them as a document. \nFor about three, maybe four years, I’d thought about sharing my lists with the hopes that if they’d helped me they may help someone else. But I chose not to share them and didn’t post any of the lists. I posted a few, less than a dozen, on my website under my birth name and got lots of positive feedback. I got a little spam, but mostly comments about the topic I’d written about that day. Again, those lists were meant as a means for me to fight my depression, not to help others on their journey. \nIt’s been several months, maybe a year now, instead of ending my lists with “Be Great. Be Grateful” that I sign off with “Abe, Be Greater!!!” The reason I sign the lists is it’s kinda like a letter. Abe in my moniker or pen name. It’s something I’ve adopted and began using about a year ago, but with little intent. Today, the moniker is something I’m more focused on and the reason is simple. I almost died from an accident in February. I’m thinking now that since I’ve been given a new chance at this thing called life, I may as well abandon the old me and start fresh with a name more aligned with the philosophy I’ve adopted and embraced.\nThe reason I wrote all of that is to explain how long things take without intent. Defined as “intent or purpose” or “resolved or determined to do something” intent comes directly from the Latin word “intentus” or “a stretching out.” Part of my experience is not writing with intent or purpose. It’s a metaphor for life as well. When we aren’t intentional, life happens to us. When we live with intent, life happens for us. \nIt took me a decade to start writing these lists for someone else. That’s not the best for the most, that’s what can I get out of this. My Creator, in my belief, didn’t bring me into existence to do what’s best for myself, but rather to serve me fellows. Had I started writing these lists with the thought of helping others, I may have done so more consistently. I may have impacted others in profound and lasting ways. I may have been able to serve a broader audience more effectively, but that’s not what happened. I may have grown more as a man, as a writer, as a speaker, as His servant. Not to sound as if I’m unappreciative, because I’m profoundly thankful for how I’ve benefited, but my lack of intent didn’t do the best for the most.\nBeing intentional requires focus. Being intentional requires discipline. Being intentional requires commitment. Being intentional requires us to make decisions. At first, at least in my case, it appears as if these things limit my options and choices, and that’s true, but it’s not a negative thing. When I cut off or decide to do a certain thing, other options fall away. When I decide to be intentional, my power grows. Power means the ability to do something or act in a particular way.\nImagine this: You perform one thing for four years, then you qualify to perform the next thing which takes you an additional six years to qualify to take a licensure exam. That doesn’t mean you automatically pass the exam, but it does mean you’ve met the requirements to take the exam. That’s forty hours per week and fifty weeks per year performing this one thing, being an electrician. Investing that much time into a thing does limit your options. Investing that much time into your career does eliminate your choices. You wouldn’t want an electrician repairing your car or truck. You wouldn’t want an electrician removing your appendix. You wouldn’t want an electrician giving you a root canal. But, when it’s time for any type of electrical work, these electricians are exactly the ones to speak with. \nWe have a finite amount of time on the Earth. We can live with intent or wander along this planet until our time is up. I’ve decided to live with intent. I’ve decided to live with purpose. I’ve decided to live with focus, clarity, discipline, and it’s revitalizing. Part of my intent are in these lists. They aren’t specifically for you, but “write something everyday” echoes when I write. Words by my mentor about a decade ago still resonate. Be intentional and document how life changes.\nToday, Monday, August 26, 2024, I am grateful that: \nI’ve got options. The more I do this one thing, the more options I have. The more I focus, the more options I have. The more I do what I was created to do, the more options I have.\nI’m truly writing to my audience now. I hadn’t really thought about that for months now. I changed my ending and I’ve actually been writing to someone, perhaps you, but I hadn’t really thought much more about it. Now that I’m doing so, it actually feels a bit more inspiring.\nThe weekend was relaxing. I’m getting some things finished this week. I’ll be busy and productive. It’s challenging at times, but I only get this one chance and I refuse to squander it as I believe I have with previous opportunities.\nAre you being intentional? With your family? Your friends? Your career? Your faith? Your life?\nGet clear. Get going today.\nAbe, \nBe Greater!!!"

        "content": "Being Reflective\nNot like a mirror, but remembering  and assessing things that have happened, whether in your recent or distant past. That’s me today, thinking about this week in particular. From regaining the ability to write, well type, again, to past failures and successes to the start of the year, that’s how my thoughts have manifested this morning. I’m not a rise and shine morning person, I am certain I didn’t inherit that trait from my parents, yet my thoughts are somewhat racing this morning.\nAs I sit here, I’m listening to my morning routine music. A playlist I created and changed several times over the years. It’s uplifting and gets me in the mood to do what needs to be done. I know how much I’ll write by the end of three songs. I know when I’ll take a short break, grab more coffee, maybe a cigarette, then two more songs while I write what I’m grateful for, I created and have maintained this routine since 2017 while living in Rio de Janeiro, writing the first draft of my first book. The list has worked even when I didn’t want to. My body remembers what I’m supposed to do when those particular songs are playing that particular order and feeling like it or not, I write.\nThis week has been more akin to coming home after a long absence. Maybe like visiting my elementary or high school after not being a student there in decades. It’s like I’m living in a nostalgic period this week, but I know it’s not a dream, but more of a dream come true. I’m still on the planet. I’m still working towards my purpose. I’m still willing to do whatever it takes. I’m similar to, yet profoundly different from the previous version of myself. \nToday, Friday, April 5, 2024, I am grateful that:\nHerb and I got a chance to speak yesterday. Thursdays are a day I truly look forward to. The camaraderie, the friendship, the collaboration, and most importantly, his wisdom are are condensed into a short 30 minute call. It’s my hope he gets as much out of our conversations as I do.\nDr. Kain and I got a chance to catch up too. There’s an old adage “you are who you hang out with” and I’ve got a bunch of highly educated, successful, family oriented, and God fearing people in my circle. We had a great conversation and she verified my willingness to speak at an upcoming event in June or July. She wanted to check my temperature on speaking to a couple hundred women during the event. As long as I can make a positive impact, doesn’t matter if it’s a couple, a couple dozen, or a couple thousand people, I’m in and willing to serve.\nI finally have a concrete, weel it’s forming, idea on how to share these lists. It’ll manifest within the following few days. I’ve got a bunch to get done this weekend, but finally, an entire platform dedicated to similarly aligned people is available and free to start. I’m in!\nHow often do you reflect or assess yourself?\nPast and present performance in the following areas: professionally, financially, spiritually, relationships(romantic and plutonic)?\nHow much better would your circumstances be if you did these assessments more often, more consistently?\nWhat changes did you make from your last assessments?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "content": "Being Tired\nIt’s been over four months since my accident and well over five years since arriving in the Philippines. Tangibly speaking, I am no further along today than I was when I left America in 2018. With the exception of one published book, which was written and edited and only needed a few tweaks, I have very few tangible proof to show my progress. I am tired.\nI’m tired of little to no tangible results. I’m tired of little to no money in my bank accounts. I’m tired of living as if tomorrow will come when February the first proved that may not be the case. I’m tired of this mediocre existence. It is no longer acceptable. It probably, in all honesty, never was acceptable. I tolerated it with the thought that I had time. Now, that’s no longer the case. I don’t think I have much time left.\nI’m not trying to sound all morbid and depressed or anything along those lines. The thing I’m conveying is I’ve hit the wall. I’m, as I’ve heard before, sick and tired or being sick and tired. I’m no longer willing to accept these down times. I’m no longer willing to accept slowed or decreased momentum. I am no longer willing to not put in the maximum effort today. Today and everyday I draw breath, I will move forward with urgency and certainty. \nThe past is history. My prior experiences and choices place me in my present situation. Good, bad, or indifferent, I am where I am from my decisions. Some I would change, some I would not. The point of getting older and wiser is applying lessons from your past when making present decisions. I have to do that today. \nA quick assessment tells me a few things could, and need to, change. I work with a relaxed and casual approach versus when I was in Sales. At a car dealership, all your numbers are erased at the beginning of each month. What happened in May doesn’t matter on day one of June. \nI have to erase my past accomplishments and start fresh each day. The last week of the month, particularly the last few days, are all intense in nature. Most sales people work open to close and all basically order food for delivery or bring their own food to work. For those last few days, we live at the dealership from open to close. We all want to hit our numbers, to maximize our bonuses, and max out our pay plan. The best way to accomplish this is by putting in the longest hours possible and working with an intensity we don’t exhibit the rest of the month. Those, and I include myself in this, are traits of amateurs. Professionals behave differently. \nProfessionals come early and stay late. Professionals obsess over serving the needs of their clients. Professionals work with what an amateur would consider intensity, yet pros just call it work. As I’m writing this it’s occurred that I’ve been an amateur for over five years now. I’d become complacent and thought and behaved as if my past accomplishments would carry me through to some sort of imaginary finish line. I was wrong. \nI’m tired of being tired. I’m tired of masquerading as an amateur when I’m a professional. Behind closed doors, in conversations with close friends, I behave as a professional. But work ethic wise over the last few years, I’ve been a neophyte. A spoiled, childish, and entitled for no reason brat living on the accomplishments of another, my former professional self. This behavior is no longer acceptable and will no longer be tolerated. \nToday, Tuesday, June 11, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI’ve had an epiphany. It’s really time to step it up and seize the day. I am done living the way I’ve been living. \nI’m willing to put in the work. It’ll be uncomfortable and time consuming, but it’ll be worth the effort. I’ll work towards the end results and delay instant gratification.\nI’m jus about finished with Herb’s program. I’ve got a few more hours to finish today. I’ll work on getting it done today. I’m just tired of working on this project and want to move on to another project.\nHave you hit your bottom?\nAre you done doing it the way you’ve been doing it?\nWhat are you willing to change?\nWrite those things done now.\nStart with the first item on the list today.\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

The construction outside of my place, having the need for a domestic helper, and a lack of discipline have all been contributing factors for my delay. Some days it’s best to be flexible. Today just happens to be one of those days. I’m typically rigid in my morning routine, but today that was not the best route, I felt, to take.\nAbout all I’ve got to say about today is it’s nearly over. Some days are more frustrating than others. Today wasn’t one of those days. I’m basically brain dea. I have learned that writing late at night or after most of the day is gone is not the best time. I am not a morning person by any stretch of the imagination, but for writing, mornings work best. \nOne thing that I’ve leaned is that, if it’s important I’ll lose sleep. That’s the case for my list. It’s not about sleeping sice I’m not so tired, but it’s about getting it done. It’s about keeping a commitment. Keeping a commitment to myself and to others. No one is reading these outside of me. In fact, I don’t read them after I write them. These are first draft only and I like it that way. I don’t get a chance to edit my thoughts, which in essence is what my lists are. Typically my first thoughts of the day. A time to relax, drink my coffee, and commune with my Creator. That’s not the case today, but the exception makes the rule.\nToday, Wednesday, April 24, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI honored my commitment to myself. Esteem means to respect and admire. By keeping my word, doing what I said I would, I build respect and admiration for myself. Constantly disappointing myself and lying about what I will do is the worst way for me to increase my admiration, my warm approval as defined by a dictionary.\nJovy worked today and got things done. My finances are getting thin for the moment and it’s a challenge to afford her salary. She is vital during this phase of my recovery. It may change and I’m hoping rather quickly, but for now, having the assistance of another eases some of my daily challenges. \nI got to have a few conversions today. From Derald to Diana and a couple of others. I am fortunate to have a host of friends. Some I’m closer with and confide in more than others. But the mere ability to pick and choose from such a wide array of experienced, intelligent, savvy, and compassionate group of friends is truly a blessing.\nDo you admire yourself?\nDo you hold yourself in high esteem?\nWhat have you done today to increase your self esteem?\nIf you’ve done nothing so far, what will you do before you sleep tonight to raise your self approval?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

He’d informed me of his problem and I offered a viable solution. The business owner is a referral from a friend of mine and I am always accommodating to referrals. \nDuring our conversation we discussed my rate. This particular project is hourly and I’d offered him a rate 25% lower than my posted rate. He seemed thrilled at the time and I was more interested in the project and revenue stream than my hourly rate. These freelance gigs come and go, so I’m not interested in holding fast to a rate when I hadn’t worked in over a month. \nHis message today said, in effect, we’d like to move forward, but at a lower rate. I’m not sure if I should compromise, negotiate, or be unreasonable. I don’t believe I’m being unreasonable. I discounted my rate already, which, in hindsight, may have been a mistake. I’ve done all the negotiating I’m willing to do, at this point. Had I listened to one of my mentors a couple of years ago and tripled my rate, I wouldn’t even be working or searching for these types of positions. “If we don’t learn from the past, we’ll keep repeating it.” Sooner or later, I’ll learn the lesson.\nToday, Wednesday, January 10, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI’ve at least got an option for a contract. It’s been roughly a month since my last one and albeit smaller than what I typically command, it’ll at least cover my expenses.\nMark continues to send me opportunities. Most of the work I’ve done on this particular platform has been a direct result or a referral from him. He’s single handedly kept me afloat over the last year by sending referrals.\nI’m willing to continue to apply for positions. Proposals require a bunch of time. First the searching for, then reading of, and finally submissions of actual positions. It’s a bit tedious, but at this stage, my reputation isn’t strong enough to have people coming to me.

I can see exactly how I’d like the end product offering, but the technology doesn’t exist. I can see where and how it’ll evolve over the next few months, or maybe years, but it’s not there just yet. I’m making due with what’s available and running with a contingency plan. \nThe plan is simple and straightforward. Launch with what’s available. When newer and better becomes available and plausible, iterate. Waiting costs money and opportunity. The opportunity cost could be huge and it’s not worth waiting. I could be waiting indefinitely and those I serve would be deprived. The contingency and counter offer are more for myself and ideal version of how I envision things, as opposed to a client offering, but I’m my worst client at times.\nMy launch is set for July 30, so my countdown has begun. It would be ideal to launch with tons of content, at least 25 or 30 different titles, but my counter offer will be ten titles. I can get to ten and perhaps closer to twenty, but it’s taken a bunch to flatten this learning curve. There’s still more I could do to flatten the curve and speed up the process, but that’ll delay my launch. I’m not okay with waiting and I’ll make due with what I have. I can automate and implement other systems as we grow, but getting an offering to the market is vital. \nThe great visions and ideas are worthless unless market tested. I could be wasting my time. I could have a bunch of grandiose plans that the market doesn’t embrace. The only way to be certain is to launch. To put forth my best offering at the moment and iterate based on market feedback. I’ll do those things and much much more. The days of talking and not doing are gone. The days of doing and talking very little are here. Today and every single day moving forward, my objective is to move silently. My actions will speak volumes. \nToday, Monday, July 22, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI’m willing to move forward. Ideal or not, I’ll move forward. The delays of not moving forward are opportunity costs. The cost of the opportunity when dealing with technology could be a closed window, meaning no opportunity at all.\nI’ve matured in the previous area. Procrastination was part of my history and that could be because I wanted things to be perfect. Perfect may be an illusion and perfection may very well be something to strive for but never, or rarely achieve.\nI overslept this morning. I have been getting up and moving around before 5 since moving back to the city. This morning I slept until well after seven and it felt good. I’m a couple hours behind in my morning routine, but I must have been more tired than I knew and needed the rest.\nWhen your ideal version is delayed, what’s your contingency?\nHow well do you make counter offers?\nWhat’s the last countdown or deadline you set?\nWhat’s your next deadline?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "content": "Craving Creation\nFor about a week or so I’ve been wanting to do nothing more than create. That’s it. No more, no less. Only create. For me, at this stage, that’s really all I desire. For those that don’t know me and to document this for my future self, I’ll dive a bit into exactly what I mean. \nCreate means to bring something into existence. It comes from a Latin word meaning to make, to bring forth and comes from can also mean arise or be born. All of that to say, I’ve been craving or a powerful desire for something, which is what craving means. To put it all together. For the past week or so, I’ve been having a powerful desire to bring forth or bring something into existence. \nFor over six years now, I’ve been living with purpose. It’s taken me away from my place of birth to Brazil. I spent 72 wonderful days in another country, writing my autobiography with a constant headache. The inability to communicate effectively, to think of every word, every single time I had to speak, was mentally taxing to put it kindly. Yet, I finished the first draft before leaving, even though I needed to extend my stay beyond my initial plan.\nLiving with purpose brought me back to America where I briefly jumped into two new professions, some would and have chosen them as careers. First doing disaster inspections for those affected by recent storms, then as a Loan Office for a government agency. The agency offered Disaster Loans as a means of relief for those affected by natural disasters. Afterwards, I finished the rewrites on my autobiography and soon found myself on a plane to Manila.\nMy thoughts and plan were to stay in Manila for six weeks. Over five years later, I’m still in the country. During this time, I’ve had the opportunity to explore a few other endeavors, but most seemed short lived and not inline with my purpose. When I asked the question, “How will this help you fulfill your purpose?” I inevitably heard, “it won’t.” So each of those endeavors were short lived. \nWithout fail, every morning I state my purpose before getting out of bed. Without fail, since discovering my purpose I’ve thought and believed it was possible. Without fail, I know it’s the reason I exist so I continue to move forward. \nAfter being nearly killed by a reckless driver in February of this year, I had lots of down time. I focused on my recovery. After the fog lifted from the pain medication, I thought I could fulfill my purpose by telling of how I’d accomplished those things outlined above by living with purpose. I put that course together and realized something. My name, my brand, my story isn’t big enough. During this time, I was also able to become proficient in using more tools. As a result, I discovered my course was part of the self help and personal development sector. I recalled the limited success from my autobiography and chose another route. \nI decided to leverage the influence of others. I decided that I could leverage the biggest names in the industry and form partnerships. After all, I’d become an embodiment of living the principles within the pages they’d written. I’d read and studied and lived those words for decades. I also recalled that in order to reach my destination, I needed to know exactly where I was going and how I would get there. \nI currently possess all those things now. I know where I’m going. I know how to get there. I know how long it’ll take. I know how much it will cost. Heck, I even have a clear vision of two of the people along for the ride. I’ve put in all the work needed to be at this jumping off place. Now, more than anything else, I crave creating. Now, I have a strong desire to bring my company into existence. \nThe company will create a means to reach others yet to be popularized. The company will disseminate information in a manner most are familiar with. The company will deliver information to an audience already familiar with the most prominent and influential voices in the industry. Yet, the delivery will be the most easily accessible to date. This method will iterate over the years as most things do, but this will be the beginning. \nNow, I crave creating. I crave the ability to put this company together. I possess a powerful desire to make this information available to an abundance of those seeking it. Interestingly enough, when I ask “How will this help you fulfill your purpose?” I get so many answers, it’s slightly overwhelming. It’s a great time to create.\nToday, Monday, September 9, 2024, I am grateful that: "

        "content": "Delayed Does Not Mean Denied\nIt may have been during Covid lockdown or shortly thereafter, I had a chance to watch a documentary. This one was about basketball player turned coach, Dawn Staley. It showed a bunch, but the thing that stuck out about the former player who’d won three Olympic Gold Medals as a player, then another gold as a coach wasn’t her play or her stats or accolades. \nThe team she coached made the college finals and lost. Coach Staley hung a sign or a banner or something in the locker room that read, “Delayed does not mean denied.” You’ve probably heard “In God’s time” or “God’s time is different then my time” or something along those lines. Things happen differently than laid out in our mind or envisioned most of the time. Some things may never come to pass and others are delayed. Sometimes things have to align behind the scenes in ways we can’t see things are lining up for our one event, but that may take some time too.\nI have a near and dear friend that I’ve know since my Senior year of high school. We had a chance to talk yesterday and she shared she’d purchased a Baby Grand piano. I knew she played, but I didn’t know she wanted a baby grand. She told me that she’s wanted one since she was 16 and decided it was time to buy one. She and her husband searched extensively and found a place with an excellent reputation within five hours of their home. They visited, chose their piano and scheduled delivery. My friend is quite practical when it comes to finances and although a new piano was well within her means, she chose to purchase a used one. The piano was delivered as agreed and about a week later her husband had a couple of questions and called the store. \nThe store proprietor answered her husband’s questions. He also asked if they noticed the difference in the piano. He informed them that although they’d agreed to a used piano and that’s what they had purchased and paid for, he felt compelled to provide them a new one at no additional cost! The cost of the new piano was nearly double the price of what my friend paid, but the owner was more than happy to absorb all the cost, never say a word, and help her achieve a thirty plus year old dream! \nWhen we move towards a thing, others can tell. She’d been drawn towards purchasing a piano for over thirty years and for one reason or another she didn’t. Once she made a decision, put in the effort to locate one, and actually purchased the piano, she’d made a small concession and purchased used instead of new. Some force beyond my comprehension compelled the store owner to upgrade her purchase at no cost. Some force compels me to keep going. Some force compels others to keep you going too. Some force, which I choose to call God or my Creator, compels others to aid in our journey. That same force ensures that although the timing may not be what we thought it would be, that “delayed does not mean denied.”\nToday, Wednesday, July 10, 2024, I am grateful that:\nAnn and I got a chance to catch up. We hadn’t spoken in months. I’d called shortly after getting out of the hospital, but wasn’t able to talk long. Her kids and husband, along with work, are all doing well. She, as always, was more concerned with my well being than talking about herself. Lifelong friends are more precious than the rarest of diamonds.\nAfter hours and hours of dealing with, tweaking, and working on my project, it’s almost perfect. I have a few ideas for enhancements that I’ll test this morning, but once those are done, I’ll be able to wrap up the project in a matter of hours. \nMy environment is changing my attitude. The way I walk, talk, and work have changed in less than two weeks. It’s not in the vicinity of where I’ll be workwise before month’s end, but it sure is progress.\nDo you confuse denied and delayed?\nHave you ever thought you were denied only to discover “it” was merely delayed?\nHow did or do you acknowledge the receipt of those things?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

Iteration aside, I’ve had to deal with all sorts of challenges over the last few days. Specifically some sort of flu, cough, congestion, and fever over the last 48 hours or so. It’s the rainy season here and with that comes a change in temperature. I’m guessing that’s what happened, but I’m uncertain. What I know for certain is I slept roughly 16 to 18 hours each day for the last couple of days. \nMy fever finally broke late last night and I rested well over the night. Even with it being Saturday, I’ll write and I’ll work. The delays won’t disrupt or dissuade my determination. My course is set. My actions are laid out. My destination is clear. All these little things that occur are simply a means of distraction. Well meaning and seemingly important in the moment, a year or two, perhaps a decade from now, those things won’t be important or significant. \nI’ve dealt with many of these over the years as I’m sure you have as well. In the moment some situations seem as if they are important, but when reflecting on them after some time has elapsed, you come to the same conclusion that I have many times. It was that important, significant, or vital as it appeared in the moment. While happening, the thing that I’m challenged to remember with frequency is to ask myself, “How will this matter this time next year?” Asking myself that question helps me get back on track most times. Some days are easier than others, but that’s what we call life. Some things are bigger and more significant than others, but most are not. When put against that one simple question, most of the time, my answer is something along the lines of “it won’t matter much or at all.”\nAll that being said, be mindful of your most high mission. Be mindful of the reason you are doing the things you are doing. Be mindful of your purpose. Be mindful of your objective. Be mindful that if and when these things occur, ask yourself, “How will this matter this time next year?” Listen for your answer and move accordingly.\nToday, Saturday, July 20, 2024, I am grateful that:\nMy fever broke and I’m feeling normal physically. Being under the weather isn’t pleasant and getting some sense of normalcy is great.\nI’m getting back to work today. It’s far from fun and it’s not enjoyable, but I can see the end result. Implementing these systems is vital. I don’t have to enjoy the process. I do take pleasure in the fact that the level of complexity makes it fairly certain that others won’t duplicate it.\nThis new place isn’t feeling so new. I’m getting to know some of my neighbors, get settled in, and making new contacts. All of which help me feel a part of this community. All of which is something I’d missed over the last year or so.\nHow will this matter a year from now?

        "content": "Destiny Awaits\nDefined as a predetermined course of events often held to be an irresistible power or agency, destiny awaits us all. Interestingly enough, the word comes from a Latin word meaning to make firm or establish. Not to be too philosophical first thing in the morning, how can I make firm or establish something that’s predetermined? Unless, or course, the meaning of the word has been changed and morphed to something it wasn’t originally used for. This happens often and it’s one of the reasons I’m grateful for being able to research word origins. \nNaturally I’ll use the original definition of the word because it’s about making firm or establishing something. We have the power of choice. More importantly thought, we have the ability to decide. It’s great to have options and choosing gives us that ability. But when we decide on a thing, a course of action, choice is removed. We’ve cut off the ability to choose and our course is set. Our decision destined us for that particular thing. We cut off, decided, on our destiny. \nI’ve made a decision. I’ve set firm or established my path. The road will be wrought with obstacles, such is life. Fortunately, it’s been established and decided. The challenge so many face is choosing one thing, then changing their minds. Changing courses, careers, jobs, spouses, partners, homes, cars, and so many other choices are made and we all do it with such regularity it appears normal. It may be normal in society, but it may not be natural. \nOf or in agreement with the character or makeup of someone or something is a truncated definition of natural. If we keep making choices that are unnatural for our character and makeup we may face all sorts of negative consequences, like I did. Being in tune with who I am, my gifts, the best use of those gifts is my greatest act of gratitude. Deciding my destiny became natural. It was uncomfortable, weird, peculiar, and quite frankly, over the last few days since it’s happened, it’s been quite unsettling. Most will never have such an experience and that saddens my soul. My essence is slightly darkened by the thought. \nTo combat this darkness, I shine. I do what I was put here to do. I decide. I establish. I move. It’s the only way I’m aware of to shine. \nToday, Monday, August 12, 2024, I am grateful that:\nThe weekend was productive. I rewrote and reproduced the videos for a project. I also made some progress on a proposal, which should be finished tomorrow. \nEven though my day is mostly over, I’m finishing my list. I like writing, but more than liking it, it’s part of who I am. At times I get distracted with life, but it’s always good to have this to come back to and get grounded.\nThe puzzle is being put together. It’s not close to being finished, but pieces are in place. I’ve got lots of work to finish and that’s okay. The thing that’s most important is the work is underway.

Some get finished in mere minutes, while others take days, weeks, or months to complete. My experience is new things always take longer than my initial estimate. If I think it’ll take four hours, it takes eight or ten. If I think it’ll take a week, it’s more along the lines of a week and a half or two weeks.

One, I could stop overestimating my abilities. That may be a bit of pride and ego. Two, I could lower people’s expectations. The adage, “Under promise, over deliver” comes to mind. Another solution is to stop taking on new things. Stop exploring and learning new stuff. \nThings I’ve done, things I’ve mastered are completed faster than I thought. New tasks, new skills, new tools and software, new system implementation, those all take longer. If I weren’t working towards the betterment of myself, my skills, my gifts, and maximizing my talent, I could simply do what I’ve done and rest on my laurels. Unfortunately for me and possibly you, I’m not where I need to be. When I say need to be I mean, physically or financially. I’m not where I need to be in the completion of my most high mission. I’m moving in that direction, but I am not there yet. \nWhen I assess my progress, my skill sets, and other assets, I can see there’s a need to change and improvement. There are areas of growth and improvement. Learning new skills, flattening the learning curve, and moving towards mastery with more momentum is the only way I’m aware of mastering what’s needed. It requires more and complaining about it is one option. The other is dig in and get it done. \nToday, Wednesday, May 8, 2024, I am grateful that:\nFor balance. There’s young and old, sweet and sour, up and down. I am tasked with finding balance. To not be too high or too low, to find a perfect combination of education and implementation. To know and not do is tragic.\nRelationships saved my life. From Kelvin and Karla getting me to a hospital that would render assistance, to friends and family paying the bill, to Sherman helping me find the place I’m currently living in. No man is an island unto himself and the people around me have been vital.\nOthers are further along the road I’m traveling. Whether it’s a formal mentor relationship, my support group or network, or random strangers on the internet, others are a bit ahead of me in my journey and they share their experience. Experience is the best teacher and it doesn’t have to be mine. I can learn from the successes and failures of others.\nDo you do your personal best everyday?\nIf not, what is one area you would like to improve?\nWhat are three ways you could improve that one thing?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "Discipline Delivers Determination",
        "content": "Discipline Delivers Determination\nThis week I’ve written about discipline. To reiterate it’s |the practice of training people to obey rules or a code of behavior, using punishment to correct disobedience. Punishment could also be considered consequences and we’ll revisit in a bit, but for now I’d like to address more of the benefits I’ve gotten from following a code of behavior. \nWhen I’m disciplined, I excel. I don’t perform comparable to my peers, I typically outperform my peers. When I’m disciplined, I keep moving forward. Discipline delivers determination. If you search for synonyms of confidence you’ll find determination. A not so often used, but quite poignant definition of determination is a tendency to move in a fixed direction. Confidence is the feeling or belief that one can rely on someone or something, it’s a firm trust. Either way you look at it, being disciplined fosters building your confidence. Your self value and self esteem will increase as you exercise more discipline. It’s true in my case and I’m certain, if you do what I did, you will get what I’ve gotten.\nToday I’m more disciplined and determined than in my past. The easiest way to start gaining confidence and determination is by being disciplined. When I was really struggling with depression, one of the therapists assigned us a task of making our bed daily. I’m not sure whether you’ve had depression like I have and I hope you haven’t, but if you have, making my bed everyday seemed like an impossible task. It seemed Herculian at times and if I recall correctly, I could only achieve this feat for about three or four days in a row. The same could be said about Herb’s assignment of writing something everyday. With this one I actually counted the days and made it a little over 90 but not quite 100 days. I’ve heard and read about people brushing their teeth or taking a shower and getting dressed as examples too, but that’s not my experience. \nI mention my experience in these matters for a few reasons, but the main one is this - it’s something just about everyone can relate to. They are simple enough tasks, but the confidence gained is really my point. By displaying a bit of discipline, I get tremendous dividends. The greatest of those is the ability to attempt more complicated tasks than the last. There’s a bit of momentum that’s created, drawing me towards my destination, my end goal, my purpose. \nFifteen years ago, the thought of moving to another country to write a book would have seemed impossible. Today, I’ve already done that and it wasn’t so bad. It took discipline, which was strengthened by performing the task.I’m a published author now and had I not faced my fear, been courageous, and followed a code of behavior (writing something everyday) I would not b able to truthfully say that. As I embark on writing another piece of literature, the outline is completed, I can reflect on what I’ve already accomplished, and if or when self doubt rears its ugly head, I can remember that I’ve already done something much more challenging. \nToday, Wednesday, May 1, 2024, I am grateful that:"

        "content": "Discipline\nPurpose, legacy, clarity, resilience, fortitude, and many other words have been used to describe those among us that achieve amazing feats. I would propose that none of those descriptors are as important as disciplined. Originally from the Latin words meaning “instruction” or “knowledge”, discipline can be defined in several ways:\nA system of rules of conduct;\nActivity or experience that provides physical or mental training; or \nControlled behavior.\nAnother definition I find quite interesting is: the practice of training people to obey rules or a code of behavior, using punishment to correct disobedience. All of these are quite appropriate definitions and it’s been my experience that when I don’t “follow or comply” with a particular code of conduct, my disobedience is punished. \nA little over a decade ago, I held a position in Sales within an Auto Dealership. About six or seven months after beginning my employment, an opportunity for a promotion was available. My prior experience was aligned with the position, but during a conversation with the hiring manager, my attendance and tardiness were mentioned as reasons for ineligibility. Personalities and politics aside, had I exercised discipline during my initial tenure, those things would not have been mentioned. I may not have been promoted in any case, but that’s merely speculative. \nWe all have times when we don’t exhibit out best versions of ourselves. We all fall short, day in and day out of peak performance. It’s relatively easy to complain and shine a light on our shortcomings, the more challenging task, and I believe, more beneficial, is to look at our improvements. Slight progress is progress. At some point in the future, I may write about the Japanese principle of “Kaizen” but succinctly, it’s the philosophy that small, incremental improvements over long periods of time make significant changes. \nA disciplined approach to my career, my spiritual life, my physical well being, my financial life, and every other area of life, can and will be improved my a more disciplined approach. The challenge most have is not following the system. \nIf you recall the first definition, “a system of rules of conduct”, you’ll may postulate the following few questions:\nAm I following rules of conduct?\nIf so, who’s rules of conduct?\nIf not, how can I find these rules of conduct?\nWhich areas of my life can I begin to apply more discipline?\nWhich rules of conduct can I follow to improve those areas?\nThose are just a few questions to help along your journey. \nToday, Tuesday, January 2, 2024, I am grateful that: \nI’m intentionally writing to my audience. In years past, I would write my lists as a means to enhance my relationship with my Creator. I believe the lists still help in that regard, but I have come to believe that these lists do not have to be singular in purpose. \nI made some progress on the domain name registration, setting up payments, and a couple of small items. “Inch by inch, it’s a cinch” comes to mind. A little finished everyday, makes for a productive week.\nI got a chance to talk to Gary yesterday. We hadn’t spoke all year, so it was good to catch up for bit. He and the family as doin well. There aren’t a bunch of people stateside I yearn to visit and commensurate with, but Gary is one of them \nHow can you exercise more discipline?\nAbe, \nBe Greater!"

        "content": "Displaying Discipline\nIf you don’t know, find out.\nWhen you find out, figure out how to do it.\nDiscipline is the adherence to a code of conduct or behavior. If you, like me in my current situation, are not where you would like to be, maybe you lack discipline. Maybe, just maybe, you are not adhering to the code of conduct or behavior. The second part of the definition of discipline is punishment to correct disobedience. Perhaps your inability to adhere to the code is being met with punishment for noncompliance. \nI have been compliant and noncompliant in my life. I’ve reaped the benefits of adhering to the code. I’ve also suffered the consequences of not obeying the code. Not to confuse the issue, but discipline can be used as a noun and a verb. We’ve discussed it as a verb, but the noun definition is a branch of knowledge, typically one studied in higher education. With that in mind, maybe you aren’t where you’d like to be because you have chosen a discipline that doesn’t add exceptional value to those you serve.\nIf your discipline is washing dishes or fixing flat tires, your value delivery isn’t the same as a surgeon. Your discipline may not deliver enough value. Value is the importance, worth, or usefulness of something. In exchange for the value we deliver, we are compensated financially. You may receive fair market compensation for the value you deliver, but the discipline you chose may not compensate enough to meet your desires.\nToday, my chosen disciplines are compensated fairly to achieve what I desire. Today, I’ve been noncompliant, I’ve lacked discipline or adherence to the code of conduct. Today, I can honestly say my ignorance to the code, with respect to this area, is my main inhibitor. I’ve been researching, reading, and working to develop an understanding of the market, the field, the tools, and the potential of this area. Yet, I’m not adhering fully. Those things aren’t engrained and part of my essence or being. They are foreign because they’re new and I’ve failed to fully integrate them into what I do and who I am. \nI’m currently living and working in Stage Two of learning, and sometimes Stage One. I don’t know what I don’t know or I’m aware I’m doing the wrong thing. I haven’t gotten to Stages Three or Four, doing the right thing but it takes effort or doing the right thing and not even thinking about it. I’m still learning. \nIf any of this resonates, if you’re there and don’t know how to get unstuck, there’s hope. There’s a chance to keep honing your craft, putting arrows in the quiver, building and developing personally and professionally. If none of these thing sound familiar and you can’t relate in the least bit, be content where you are or invest some time in quiet contemplation with your Creator, asking for insight.\nToday, Friday, August 16, 2024, I am grateful that:\nIt’s been an enlightening day and week. I’ve had some insights which have never occurred. I’m uncertain if it’s growth, but I’ll accept it as such. \nI’m more comfortable seeing my deficiencies now than before. I’m no way near perfect, but the more progress I make towards it, the better of a man I become. \nI can clearly see how to get where I’m going. The road will be filled with obstacles, but I’m suspecting that’ll only be in the beginning. I’m capable and more than willing to drudge this path to its very end.\nHow will you display your discipline?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

From surfing the internet to social media to apps on my phone and computer, there’s no shortage of distractions. There’s also the rare incoming call. The return of one of my calls when a friend says they’ve got something for us, something we can do together. \nLast night I got that particular call. A great, unheard of niche that will be lucrative. It’s happened several times since my accident. Another one from a fellow writer, one from a marketing guru, all within the last six weeks. The power of NO comes from having some clarity. By one definition, clarity means the quality of being coherent and intelligible. I couldn’t recall the definition of coherent right away, but when I did, it really makes more sense. Clarity means the quality of being logical and consistent. With that being said, although every opportunity sounds great, it’s not great for me. \nThis morning one of the children around my place was playing with newly born kittens. His intent was about the same as all kids his age, to play and have fun. But his actions could have harmed the kitten. That’s put me in a bad mood this morning. Kids are kids and they just don’t know. But my inability to command the local dialect, coupled with his mother’s inability to understand English led to some challenges in communication. My helper is here now and she’ll sort things out since she’s conversational in both languages, but it’s still been a distraction.\nSure I’m writing, but it’s a little later than I would have liked. Sure, my mood is a bit off and not my normal even keel. Sure, my hand is beginning to hurt and go numb once again, but the thing is, even with distractions, I must push forward. I have the quality of being logical and consistent. My history of bouncing from career to career, not just job to job, shows it doesn’t make sense to switch to something else. My history of being inconsistent shows that it doesn’t make sense to not write today. That’s my experience, yours maybe different, but mine shows that I am on the right path even though I’m unable to clearly see the finish line. I know the path I’m travelling will get me to my destination, but only if I don’t stop. \nToday, Thursday, April 18, 2024, I am grateful that:\nDC and I got a chance to catch up for a bit. It’s been a challenging journey for us both over the last few months. It was good to hear him in better spirits. \nWriting has returned. It’s painful at times, but it feel normal to write. It’s part of who I am and what I do. I’ll evolve as I master my craft, but this is the foundation. Consistently writing during the work week and getting to a point, like my mentor, that my work week and my regular life will be daily, not confined to Monday through Friday. To do what I was created for will require more than a traditional work week. My purpose is not traditional. My work ethic has to become not traditional.\nAlan responded to a message earlier. I’ve got tons of respect for the man. He once saved my life and stayed with me until I was not in peril. Until I draw my last breath, he and I will be good.\nHow do you deal with distractions?\nList three ways\nAbe, \nBe Greater!!!"

As you move into your mission, your purpose, a decision must be made. As you travel down the road, you will encounter distractions, delays, and disappointments. These have all happened for me, and I’m certain my journey isn’t unique. \nI’m unique, yes. My journey is my own. The journey may be unique, but the obstacles that arise are not. Religious folks may call it the enemy or Satan. Others may find different labels, today the ones I provided work best. Tomorrow those labels may change, but for this writing, they will suffice.\nWhen a racing horse, a thoroughbred is in the gate, heck, before it enters the gate, it has blinders on. These blinders keep the horse’s attention on the path directly ahead. When a horse has blinders on, it moves with certainty, as do we. Focus is something that may be overlooked too often. A man or woman with focus is virtually unstoppable. Pair focus with clarity and some perseverance and accomplishing your task is only a matter of time. \nLife will bring delays. What you thought may take only a week, may take a month or six. You may have expected or projected revenue of one amount or a promotion at your job, don’t receive it or get less than you thought and become disappointed. You may be approached with other opportunities, some could appear better choices and may truly be better, for someone else. But for you, and for me, those opportunities reveal themselves as distractions. \nStay your course. Monitor your progress. Assess yourself, your mission, and your progress towards its completion. Befriend and benefit from a mentor. Listen carefully. Follow their example and ask specific questions. Your questions will be answered. Your path will produce less in the way of obstacles and distractions. Then and only then, when your mission is nearly completed, remove your blinders.\nUntil such time, stay focused. Move straight ahead with speed. You can accomplish your task. Others have who are, or were, much less capable than yourself. You are composed of talents and skills, moxy, or better still, pure grit - beyond your current understanding. As you move forward, just like me on this journey, you’ll discover things about yourself unknown today. Do not yield. Do not relent.

These three things adapt and take many shapes and sizes, but the end result is the same, if I allow it. In more instances than I care to admit or acknowledge, I’ve allowed these things to stop my progress. Under the guise of flexibility, adapting, or going with the flow of life, I’ve had my progress thwarted. As I sit here, fingers on the keyboard, rigidity comes to mind.\nOriginally from Latin, meaning stiffness, it’s directly opposed or opposite of flexibility. I pride myself on my flexibility and willingness to adapt and morph in situations. Yet, this may be my downfall or cause of my current situation. It’ll take a bit more appraising, but it may be true. Discipline is the adherence to a code of conduct or behavior and maybe, just maybe, my ignorance to adhere to the code has caused me to foster and embrace flexibility. \nI’m going to have to really look and evaluate this proposal I set forth. It may be the “taproot” of my current and previous circumstances in life. I’m uncertain and although I want to stop writing and dig deeper, I need to finish this for myself knowing it may help others as well. This is one of the magical effects of writing in the mornings.

It’s an undeniable truth, yet most of us, myself included, act as if we have all the time in the world. I have, and at times continue, to behave as if I’ve got time to spare. The reality is quite different from my delusional thoughts. \nThis weekend I had the chance to watch some of the highlights from basketball. The regulation time limits are 48 minutes. There are four twelve minute quarters. If the winner isn’t decided within that time, there’s an overtime period. The point I’m making is the players, coaches, and refs all know the amount of time to be played. The fans know this as well. The players move with purpose, with focus, and they summon their talents towards one end, victory. \nIt’s playoff season now. The games are more intense as all the remaining teams are vying for a shot at being world champions. Now the players are in the conference championship round with the winners from the Western and Eastern conference series playing each other in the Finals. The winner of the Finals will be the world champion. Of the 30 NBA teams, four remain playing. But only one will be world champions. All the teams have to play within the constraints and rules of the game. They all know the rules before the season starts and they all play accordingly. \nBasketball and life have similarities. We all know we will die. It’s part of life, an inevitable part. Unlike basketball, we don’t know if we get 48 minutes. Sadly, some barely get the first quarter and die as teenagers. The average life span for a male in the United States is 76 years. As men, our quarters are 19 years, unlike the 12 minutes of basketball. At 52, I’m nearing the end of my third quarter. Since some struggle with arithmetic, I’ll explain. First quarter is the first 19 years of life. Second quarter is the next 19 years or until age 38. The third quarter is another 19 years taking you to age 57. The fourth or final quarter is from 57 to age 76, if you’re average. There have been and always will be outliers, but those are the averages. \nI would encourage you to live life like your playing basketball. Think about and remember which quarter you’re in. There are no do overs. There isn’t a reset button like video games. This game of life keeps going, keeps moving, and whether you like it or not, it will end. When the game is over and the final score is tallied, how will you be viewed. Will you be considered an all time great? Will you be put in life’s equivalent of the Hall of Fame? Remembered throughout history? Or will you be like so many others…soon forgotten.\nIt’s your game. It’s your life. Since no other you will ever exist, make them all remember who you are, what you did, and how you played the game.\nToday, Tuesday, May 28, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI’m making progress towards my objectives. It’s not the ideal situation for me over the last few months, but I am moving forward. I’ve made more progress in the last month than the previous months of the year combined. Mostly from the accident and recovering and partly from the sense of urgency granted.\nTechnology has advanced to a point that minimum financial resources is no longer an inhibitor. Money shouldn’t be prohibitive, but sad to say, it has been. I’ve worked to eliminate this obstacle, but it’s not entirely gone. \nIf I am indeed average, I’m nearing the end of my third quarter. It could be my fourth quarter, but the point is that I’m still here. As long as I wake up and inhale, I have the opportunity to make the most of the game. It’s not everyday I think of this, but it’s true whether it comes to mind or not. \nDo you have your plan?\nWhat quarter are you in?\nAre you playing the game of life like you’re in the fourth quarter?\nDo so now!\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

How you doing?\nstressed...got all the pieces of the puzzle so to speak, just putting them in place and prioritizing is putting me under self imposed pressure. everything i'm working on can be automated and done in less time, but i keep bouncing back and forth between manual and automation. i've gotta just finish things manually, then setup the automation. didn't realize that until i was typing this message…\nCouldn’t figure out screenshots on my computer so i copied and pasted the two relevant messages.

That’s a wonderful distraction, but a distraction nonetheless.\nWe have to remain vigilant in our purpose. We must remain steadfast on our course. We have to do the work. Automations are great.

Once it’s done and I have proof of concept completed with several testimonials about efficacy, i can move on to making things faster. There’s no rush to make things faster if it doesn’t work well for prospects and clients. \nAvoid my mistake over the pst week. Put in the work today. Do what needs to be done, right now.

I’d begun taking action towards completion of a project and it’s still not finished. It’s been well three weeks and I’m thinking over a month for this particular project. It seems as if every single thing I want to complete on this project is offering an obstacle and delaying completion. Ideally, once all my systems are built and functioning this process will be completed in less than four hours, but today none of those systems exist.\nMy concept is about all that exists of the systems. I have a solid idea of how to make it work and how to implement the systems. I do not possess the expertise to put these systems in place so I’m doing every task manually and it’s more time consuming. I’ve spent long hours in front of my computer screen before and did it again yesterday. It was evening before I took a stroll around my neighborhood to relieve some anxiety, knowing I wouldn’t continue working that night. \nIn life we don’t always get to do what we want, but we ought to do what’s needed. I needed to put the time in yesterday. I need to put the time in today. I’ll need to do the same amount of effort for the next few weeks. I can see the finished product, the end result of my efforts, and how the various pieces of the puzzle fit together. The challenge is putting them all in place. Actually, the challenge is the correct order, it’s sequencing. \nAs I’m writing this I see my folly. I began building my house without laying the foundation. I started the construction only having chosen my location. I may have cleared the lot of debris and what not, but I didn’t outline nor lay a proper foundation. That’s the problem. I’m thinking back about six or seven weeks ago and I’d come to the realization that the automations would be vital, but after manually completing the tasks. I’m frustrating at the time to manually complete the tasks, but it’s the foundation. Without a solid understanding of the basics, intermediate or advanced systems and functions will surely fail. \nI’ll keep doing things manually. I’ll work to get all things done. I’ll iterate later. I’ll build and implement systems later. Today, it’s about the foundation. Setting the groundwork in place and properly. An edifice of any significance must have a proper foundation. The same is true for any business. \nToday, Tuesday, July 16, 2024, I am grateful that:\nEpiphanies happen. While writing it happened. My frustration for not completing this project was growing, but now I understand the significance of getting it right in the beginning as compared to trying to go back and fix it later. \nI’m well rested and ready for another productive day. Living in this new environment and being around and interacting with so many like minded people is really uplifting. It’s reminding me of what I’ve done, what I’m doing, and encouraging me to remain vigilant, resilient, and focused.\nI completed part one of my project yesterday.

These few months are teaching me the same lesson again. Doing the uncomfortable yields exceptional results.\nWe have evolved to avoid the perils of day to day life.

I still require assistance and they have been interfering with her ability to assist for weeks now. It has never been acceptable, but I tolerated it, partly out of guilt and in part as partial payment for them helping save my life. Another part of this culture is they don’t confront people. Lying, cheating and the like are tolerated and rarely discussed. If they are discussed the person doing wrong will apologize and say something along the lines of “I didn’t know.” It’s just different from how I learned to deal with things.\nYour journey may have similar episodes. You may leave a job, a career, a country or two, but you are everywhere you go. It’s been my experience that I will either learn the lesson or repeat it. If I don’t do what’s uncomfortable the instances or similar ones will continue to present themselves. It’s happened repeatedly, from relationships to quitting one job before I have another one. \nThe bottom line for me is life can and will be challenging. Making the easier softer choice is probably not the route for me to travel. When I run towards comfort, I’m turning my back on growth and possibly His will. I don’t actively seek out discomfort, but when I am faced with it, I will walk towards it instead of running away from it. \nToday, Thursday, April 11, 2024, I am grateful that:\nExamples are coming to mind that will help others. My life has been wrought with challenges. If sharing my conquests and challenges can help other people, I will do so.\nI’ll be able to get the audio track for one of my courses finished today. Syncing the audio track to the presentation slides is a bit challenging since it’s not what I do for a living, but I keep reminding myself that it may benefit others. So I’ll do what needs to be done.\nI was able to have an uncomfortable conversation yesterday. I had the conversation with an even head, not angry, I was quite upset when it happened and I grateful for not saying something when angry.\nAre you running for what’s uncomfortable?\nAre you willing to be uncomfortable a bit?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!"

        "content": "Don’t Deliberate, Iterate\nAs a verb, deliberate means to engage in long and careful consideration. To the extreme and for this discussion it can also be a means of procrastination. Meaning at times it can seem as if I’m carefully considering something, but considering, doesn’t mean acting. We can consider crossing a road, but we remain on the side we’re on until we take action. Looking without leaping has its merits as well, but in this case some discernment is merited.\nWith this particular project I’ve been working on for a few months now, I deliberated or carefully considered a plethora of options. After all the research, I made a decision on the best available tools at the time. Now, a couple months later some additional tools are on the market and quite capable, and perhaps better than the tools I’ve selected. I could begin considering the new tools again and start the entire process over. I could also move forward with the best option when I began and make an update at a later time. \nThe speed at which technology advances could have me with nothing on the market for the next decade. I could keep researching and considering various options, only to have those options out of date when the research is completed. If we amend our business model to iterate consistently then it’ll provide the best available continuously. I believe this will best serve our partners. Kaizen is a business philosophy of continuous improvement and applicable. \nAdapting and implementing a system of continuous improvement should prove valuable to our partners and the clients they serve. The Dead Sea has little water coming in, salinity levels are toxic to most creatures, and that’s primarily because only a little comes in from the Jordan River. If it were a business it would have been bankrupt long ago. Constant improvement from multiple sources feed you and your business. Like the 17 major tributaries feeding the Amazon River, your organization will thrive and become complex while serving numerous entities and individuals.\nThat all being said, I hope, drills down on my point of making iteration a constant compared to deliberation. I can get “analysis paralysis” and keep thinking but not acting. Business is a life form unto itself and requires movement for its survival Stagnation means death. Move, act, grow, and thrive from where you are today. You can improve on things later, but you can’t change what doesn’t exist. \nToday, Friday, July 12, 2024, I am grateful that:\nHerb and I got a chance to talk yesterday. Not our typical conversation, I was out and about and it was raining, but a truncated call with a bad reception is better than no call at all.\nI’m making progress on project completion. The first program should be finished today. I’ll begin work on the second tomorrow and the third on Sunday. Hoping to complete one per day for the foreseeable future. We’ll see how that develops.\nI’m getting more acclimated to being back in the city. I didn’t know how much I fit in here until I left then returned. Living in the city is where I’d like to be the majority of the time. \nThe Kaizen philosophy came back to mind this morning. Iteration and or small improvements over a long amount of time will have significant impact. It’s not something just for today but for generations to come.\nAre you in analysis paralysis?\nHow will you move forward?\nAre you willing to start today and improve in the future?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

I had great ideas, but rarely took action. I did so many things mentally, but not physically. It’s incredible how many things I thought of and didn’t do. That’s part of my history, but not my present. Today, my ability to take action has drastically improved. Today, I’m the most action oriented I’ve even been and yet, there’s always room for improvement. \nTimes get tough, things need to get done, and talking won’t do it in most cases. In most instances, real action need to be taken. Those friends are probably still talking. I wouldn’t know cause we don’t talk anymore. “Birds of a feather, flock together” and with that, I surround myself with those interested in taking action. Some have grown comfortable and I would dare say complacent. I’m still hungry. I’m incredibly uncomfortable. I’m willing to take the action needed to advance in this journey. Most are not and that’s fine for them. I’m not here to judge any person’s action or inaction. I am here to strengthen my relationship with my Creator. I’m here to fulfill His purpose for me. I’m here to do that. I requires being uncomfortable. It requires action. I’ve learned, from personal experience, either do it or shut up. \nToday, Tuesday, January 16, 2024, I am grateful that: \nA couple more opportunities have appeared. Each in their own right helps me move towards fulfilling my purpose. One is long term and will take lots of cooperation of some powerful people and entities. The other is quite straight forward and will only elbow grease and ingenuity. \nVictoria and I spoke today. Great conversation and we’ll be moving forward together on an endeavor. The preliminary research shows it’ll fill a void and service and quite underserved market.\nMy contract started today. It’s my lowest hourly rate in over a year. I am still looking for additional contracts as this one will be insufficient to meet my needs for this quarter. But something is better than nothing.\nDo you talk more than you act?\nIf so, be still and know you must act.\nIf not, are you certain the actions you are taking move you in the right direction?\nAre you certain the actions you are taking are in the right sequence?\nIf you’re uncertain or there’s any doubt, perhaps you should seek wise counsel.\nAbe,\nBe Greater"

        "content": "Elite Enigmatology\nOne of the most challenging questions I’ve faced is how. Specifically, how do I pull all of these seemingly unrelated tools together to build or craft the life I desire?\n“The what and the why are free, the how requires a fee” are words of Dr. Kain. She said this to me a few years ago and they still ring true. The what is the life I desire, fulfilling my life’s purpose. The why is, it’s the reason I exist. Yet the elusive how may not be as elusive as it once was. \nEnigmatology is the study of puzzles. I’ve been studying this puzzle of a life worth living, a life that’s meaningful, impactful, and perhaps desirable to others, in their own versions. Elite means as select group that is superior in terms of ability or qualities to the rest of a group or society. Discovering the pieces of the puzzle, how they fit together, and viewing the puzzle in its entirety before completion, requires a superior quality most don’t possess or choose to use.\nSeemingly random tools and resources have been in my presence for a couple of years now. From no code tools, coding languages, large language models, my gratitude lists, my mentors old and new, and even more have all been present. Yet, none of the pieces seemed to fit until this weekend. Over the last 48 to 72 hours, all of the pieces have begun to coalesce, forming my puzzle. It’s refreshing. It’s confirmation that quitting before you get there yields nothing. Had I abandoned my course, the last few years would have been wasted time, unless and until I resumed the trip.\nThe only sad part of my discovery is my inability to write it down by hand. I don’t know why or what makes that so powerful, but it does. I will attempt today to handwrite it with my left hand, since I’m still unable to use my right hand with full functionality. I’m progressing, but not there yet and this typing will yield a numbing pain that’ll more than likely last until I go to sleep tonight. So I’m going lefty today and that’s okay too. Do what needs to be done, when it needs doing.\nToday, Monday, May 20, 2024, I am grateful that:\nClarity is returning. After months of being medicated, recovering from my accident, and not feeling like myself it’s great to get some sense of normalcy. \nA methodology for fulfilling my purpose is forming. It’s crystal clear not only what needs to be done, but how to get it done. \nThe resources needed to properly manifest are falling or have fallen into place. I’m not entirely sure if all of the tools or people are in place, but enough are present to get started. If more are needed as I progress, I am certain those will appear also.\nCan you see your completed puzzle?\nWhich pieces go where?\nWhat pieces are missing?\nWhat can you do to start gathering those pieces?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "content": "Everywhere You Go…\nThat’s the beginning of an old adage that ends, there you are. Put it all together and you get the thing I’ve been dealing with for decades now. Everywhere you go, there you are. There’s no way to out run yourself. It’s that simple. Those things you avoid doing, avoid stopping, and delay for whatever reason, those will be with you no matter your location. Unless, and only when, you make a decision to turn the page.\nIf your life were a book, the things you continue to avoid is you rereading the same paragraph over and over. You can take the book off the shelf or put it away, only to pick it up again later, and you’re still on the same paragraph. You can pack up all your things and move to another city or country and when you pick your book back up, you’re on the same paragraph. \nIn one form or another, I’ve been reading the same paragraph for way too long. Those figurative pages would turn at a somewhat alarming rate, but he it seems the same paragraph kept repeating. I am quite certain, and I could be wrong, the paragraph is on the page again. \nIn life you keep repeating the lesson until you learn it. It’s almost the same as “Those who don’t learn from the past are doomed to repeat it.” Well, you and I have a past. We’ve gained experience, some pleasant, some not so pleasant. The thing I’m struggling with now isn’t really the same paragraph, but it’s as if it’s been rewritten. It’s quite similar to the same thing but in a different setting. \nA couple of weeks ago while doing some research for an investor pitch deck, I noticed a pattern. I did an assessment or evaluation of my past endeavors and found a pattern I hadn’t seen before. Fast forward a few weeks and I’m in thee same spot. Reading the same paragraph, but with different words. Meaning it’s the same damn story. It’s the same lesson I haven’t learned. Worse yet, if I don’t learn the lesson, overcome, then master then master the lesson, my ability to effectively and positively impact others from my lesson will be greatly diminished. \nSee, the thing I’m realizing now and it’s something that happens as we get older is this journey isn’t just about me and what I desire. Others are watching. My journey may inspire others to greatness. My journey may stop others from harming themselves or others they love. My journey may prove to be a spark in the fire that ignites the desire of another. All that means is…it’s not just about me!!!\nI get caught up in my life and my struggles and triumphs frequently. I’m sure most of us do the same thing, but the truth of it is, unless we’re living in total isolation and have adopted some sort of hermit lifestyle, we interact with others. We send and receive good and bad vibes, if you will. We do what we do and others pick up on our actions whether we’re aware of it or not. \nWith that being said, do the thing you’ve been putting off doing. That one thing that keeps you awake at night. That one thing that puts that rumble in your gut. That one thing that makes you uneasy when you think about having not done it yet. That thing, whatever it may be, that thing is your paragraph. It may come in multiple variations, but we both know it’s the same thing in a different form. My lesson, my experience, and sadly my regret is I’ve been reading various forms of the same paragraph for decades. I’m finally ready to move on to the next part of my story. I’m sure you are too and if you’re not, that’s totally okay. You are where you are and everywhere where you go, there you are.\nToday, Thursday, October 31, 2024, I am grateful that:\nWriting is familiar. Nothing much else seems so for now. I’m getting quite uncomfortable and have been for a couple of months. Maybe writing once again will remedy this current situation. I’m uncertain as to what else may help.\nHerb and I speak tonight. I’ll ask for his experience and as usual, he’ll offer some insights that hadn’t crossed my mind. It’s great being able to speak with others with more experience.\nI’m making progress towards my launch. I’m not close to being finished, but I’ll launch anyway. I could delay for another few months but that’ll get me where I am currently. Working with no progress to show. I’ll launch and be ready and aware of what could be improved for the next project. \nThat thing you keep delaying, will you do something towards it today?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

I say this from experience, not from something I’ve read about, but rather experienced. I’ve had tons of great ideas over the years. I foolishly told them to others. The others executed and I did not. They reaped the rewards and I sat by bitter, thinking how I’d been wronged.\nI hadn’t been wronged. I freely gave an idea. I shared it with someone that saw the value of the idea. Someone else took the idea and implemented it. They made it work. I, on the other hand, did not. I sat by and thought about other things to do and how great those things would become. \nTalking is great, but action is where the metal meets the road. Meaning, without action, implementation, or execution, all those great and wonderful ideas sit in our heads. In between my ears is just that. Those thoughts aren’t actually physical and they will never become physical without action. \nOnce, I heard a speaker say think about all the unwritten books lying there in the graveyard. The cemetery is filled with unrealized potential. Potential is a wonderful when it meets reality. Yet when it doesn’t it’s just something we can all see or feel, but it never comes to pass. \nIf you’re sitting around thinking of ideas, of all the great things you would or could do but don’t, if you’re seeing friends, family, and colleagues living their dreams and you’re not, there’s a key difference. Execution.\nBreak away from your distractions. Leave your phone and tablet, at a minimum turn them off. Grab a pen or pencil and some blank paper. Put your ideas on paper. Write them down. Then write down how you will make those happen. Your ability to write a perfect plan is an ideal ad it probably won’t happen the way you planned. The main reason for this is your inability and ineptitude in formulating plans. But this first plan is the beginning of something great. There will be other plans. There will be other ways to improve and you will, as will I. \nGet your plans on paper. Review them every morning and every night. Do this when you first awake. Do this before you go to sleep at night. Do not let one day pass when you do not review your plans and make some progress towards its completion. Remember, execution is key.\nToday, Thursday, June 13, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI was able to get to the city yesterday. It was good seeing Dale and Helen. Their daughter is really growing, hard to believe it’s been over five years since I met them. \nI’m becoming restless again. The times in my life when I’m unable to rest well typically mean I have unfinished business. It’s true now, just like in the past. I stayed awake finishing some things last night and will continue to do so until my objective is completed. \nMost of the tools I need to accomplish my mission are available and affordable. Those I can not afford, I will. Those that I need but aren’t yet available, will be soon. It’s a matter of time and execution and I’m well on my way.\nDo the work mentioned earlier.\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

A couple of weeks ago, same thing occurred while speaking with Sherman. Our friendship is the only thing in common. Similar instances with similar outcomes, all of them are vibing are similar frequencies. Bigger, broader, more expansive ideas and opportunities to be more impactful \nI’d believed for years my mindset was one of abundance and unlimited possibilities. I’ve also held the belief when my Creator wants me to get a particular message, He will send his messengers. When I don’t hear the message from the first messenger, He will continue to deliver the message through others, until it’s apparent. I don’t always hear Him on the first or second attempt, so it sometimes takes a while. \nRoughly a decade ago, Mike and I were smoking a cigar by his pool. Relaxing, fellowshipping, and sharing our morning routines. How we start our days, prayers we recite, writing we do, things along those lines. I shared with him my morning prayer, “God show me what you want me to do and help me get it done.” Mike nodded and without hesitation suggested, “and make it obvious.” Four words. Four small words have made a tremendous impact since the morning following his suggestion. When I pray, “God, show me what you want me to do, help me get it done, and make it obvious” remarkable things occur.\nI’m by no means an idiot. I’m by no means struck with an inability to learn new things. I have few restrictions with regards to those factors, but in comparison to my Creator, I’m a moron. An absolute imbecile, incapable of forming or having conversation with the omnipotent Creator of all. And that, in my humble opinion, is the reason He sends multiple messengers, thor various people, until I get it. Until I understand the message, there’s no way for Him to make it possible. I am His humble servant, but if and when I’m unable to understand the manner in which I am to serve, I’m worthless. \nSo I listen. I ask for discernment. I set aside quiet time to commune and listen and enhance our relationship. Then and only then can I truly do His bidding. I can only be of service when I comprehend the manner He wants me to serve. Once I move in that direction, as repeatedly proven over numerous experiences, His power to carry it out, bosters my efforts in ways incomprehensible to others. \nToday, Thursday, January 18, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI was able to receive the message. Multiple messengers, but I have heard what was conveyed. \nI have the power to do what He wants. I also know whatever I may lack is on demand, at the ready, and only needs to be asked for. It’s all available for the asking. He always provides more than I require. \nMy thoughts are more aligned with my purpose. Those thoughts and suggestions from three separate interactions confirm the need to expand my reach. I’m willing to get done what’s needed.\nHow many people do you speak with that expand your thinking?\nHow often do you speak with them?\nWhat’s one thing you can do to expand your reach today?\nAve, \nBe Greater!!!\ncogitate"

        "content": "Fear, Fantasy, and Reality\nOver the years, I’ve heard people say things like: fear stands for false evidence appearing real and eff everything and run. When it comes to fear, I seldom allow that emotion to dictate my movements. I’m not talking about the healthy fear of a tiger or bear, but rather the unhealthy, possibly toxic fear of doing something. Maybe it’s a call I need to make or a person I should be speaking to or possibly a task that needs completion. \nIt would be great to confess that I live with no fear. It would be great to say I have such faith, resolve, and conviction that the emotion never rears its ugly head. That would be great and it would also be false. Fear pops up more than I’d like to admit and the insidious part about that particular emotion is, rarely does it appears as fear. It’ll manifest in a variety of ways and it takes some quiet reflection to realize it’s actually fear and not what it appears to be in that particular moment. \nThe one thing that’s helped more than any other with regards to eliminating or lessening fear is directed assessment and reflection. I have to look at a particular situation and ask a couple of questions. The main one is “What about this situation or person is stopping me from moving forward?” Once I look at it from a slightly different angle, then a bit or clarity appears. After that, it’s a matter of belief and conviction. I ask my Creator to remove that thing or person. The fear of that thing goes away almost immediately. I then continue with my reason for existing. \nLiving in fear or fantasy isn’t as good as living in reality. You can do what me and many others have done. You can create your own reality. You can fix within you mind the ideal version of you, your income, your family, your body, your speech, and every other aspect of your life. At first it’ll seem like fantasy, but something happens, and it doesn’t take long. You begin to get what you focus on. Those things and situations, cars you drive and houses you live in start to become reality. Fear and fantasy slide to the side for your newly crafted reality. \nIt requires more than simply thinking about it repeatedly. It requires more action than you’ve probably ever taken, but the payoff, your reward is your ideal reality. Resources become apparent, truly evidence of something assisting on your new journey. Your fear subsides as you confidently embrace a reality you desire.\nToday, Tuesday, February, 25, 2025, I am grateful that:"

        "content": "Finding Your Number\nFor about a week or so I’ve been putting together an action plan. It’s not about the items as much as it is about the time and resources each item required for completion. With this info I’ll be more prepared to move forward. The thing about mapping or planning out my next few moves is I don’t particularly care for planning. \nI’ve lived without a plan for longer than I care to admit. In fact, it’s amazing I’ve been able to get as far in life as I have without proper planning. I’m aware it’s a shortfall and I’m working to eliminate or at least lessen this deficiency. \nWhen it comes to mapping things out, there’s a ton of resources available. Personally, I know exactly where I’m going, how to get there, and only need to determine how much time and money it will take. The two parts I’ve completed took a bit to get together, but they’re done. I haven’t mapped out the next century of business, but I have mapped out the first phase. The initial launch is my primary focus. Afterwards, it’s assessing and iterating for improvements. \nThis first step, the launch is challenging for a couple of reasons. First of which is doing something that hasn’t been done. I had to give myself a bit of time based on how long it’s taken to finish on step, then add a bit more time for the learning curve. I’d initially planned on launching before the end of August and I’m currently seven days behind. \nThe second step is the production costs. Each video I’m producing requires six steps at the moment, but it’s going to expand to a more in-depth editorial process which will include at least three more steps. That being said, it’ll require more time. The time is no problem, but the longer it takes to have a finished product, the more money is expended. Without a product or service offering, there’s no income. No income means bankruptcy. Bankruptcy means I didn’t get it done. To avoid this error, I need to find my number. \nThe number is two fold. How much do I need to continue production? How much will I give in order to get what’s needed? Those are the two components. I do not and probably never will believe in something for nothing. Nature has balance. I don’t get to receive without giving. To receive my number, first I have to find it, then I have to determine how much I’m willing to give in order to get it. I must move quickly too. I believe every window of opportunity closes. While my window is open, I must act decisively.\nToday, Friday, September 6, 2024, I am grateful that:\nHerb and I spoke yesterday. The more we speak, the more I realize how important our relationship is. It’s great to leverage the wisdom and expertise of those a bit further down the same path. \nThe soreness in my right hand has almost dissipated. There’s still some tingling and numbness, but there is improvement. It’s been seven months since the accident and when I get frustrated, I think of sitting there in a soft cast, on pain meds, straining to breathe, and not knowing what happened. A bit of soreness intermittently is small in comparison.\nI’ve got my number. I’m not sold on the fact it needs to be the amount it is, but I am reviewing the data and will verify today. It’s great to know my number, how it’ll be invested, and the returns or potential return on the investment. \nWhat will it take to get where you’re going?\nWhat’s your number?\nAbe, \nBe Greater!!!"

        "content": "Finish One, Start Another\nWhile writing, one of the things I had to learn was to finish one chapter before starting another. When freestyling or writing without an outline, I’d often have these racing thoughts. I’d bounce from one thing to the next or develop one point in a plot that didn’t have anything to do with the chapter I was writing. Wheat I had to learn was to finish one thought or chapter before I’d start another. \nThat holds true many many things, not just writing a book. Over the last few weeks I’d been working on two projects at the same time. One was simple enough to complete, but it required a lot of steps. I’m talking more than thirty steps, perhaps more. I’d come across a platform that allows for automation of processes and I thought it would be a great idea to implement the automation as part of my workflow. In theory that’s a great concepts, but in practicality, it didn’t work. \nFor two weeks now I’ve not completed either task. Manual completion would take about a week. Automation of the process, once completed, would take less than a day but, I have to become competent in learning the automation platform. Now I’m entering week three and neither are complete. I didn’t finish one before starting another. \nI’m also contemplating moving to another location. I haven’t found a new place, but I’m thinking about it and looking for places to live within my budget and other criteria. My lease isn’t over until next month, but here I am searching for new places. Now I can’t just find a new place with all my criteria in a week, but I surely don’t need upwards of six or seven weeks either. It’s a waste of time at this point. \nI’m realizing now more than ever, that distractions can be insidious. It’s interesting how things can seem important and relevant, but not truly be that way at all. So today I’ll work on completing things manually. Once that’s done, I’m not moving forward with the automation learning, nor the search for another place. Afterwards, I’ll work on documenting my plan. I’ll then review it daily, probably several times per day. It seems as if I’m drifting away from what’s most important and how to accomplish that singular thing. Time is of the essence and wasting it is not acceptable. \nToday, Monday, June 10, 2024, I am grateful that:\nFocus and insight are returning. For years I’d bounce from one thing to the next, rarely completing either. My history doesn’t define my future and I will not let past experiences define my present. \nI got a chance to watch Game Two of the Finals. It’s an acceptable deviation from my morning routine. It happens once a year and watching the games live is more entertaining than highlights. It also provides a “taste of home” even though this place is truly home, in my heart and my mind.\nHerb and I got a chance to talk on Thursday as normal. I took a small break from writing Friday. He’d experienced a medical event earlier in the week and even though he’s not back to normal, he’s recovering nicely.\nHow many projects are you currently working on?\nWhich one can you finish, in the least amount of time?\nFinish that one, then rinse and repeat.\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

I’m aware there are better and more efficient ways to complete the tasks, but I don’t know how to do them. The amount of time it’ll take to learn seems too long, compared to doing them the way I know how. I’m in Stage One or Stage Two of learning, either Unconscious or Conscious Competence. Basically, what I know is good for manual completion, but I’m aware there’s a better way, but don’t know how. There’s my conundrum. \nI can and likely will keep doing things manually. It’ll be less time intensive than becoming proficient at learning the tools for automation. I may choose to learn them later, but for today it’s completion is better than automation. The ability to pay an expert is beyond my reach, at the moment, so this must suffice. \nI’ve made decisions financially that prohibit my ability to hire experts. There’s no right or wrong in this instance, merely a statement of fact. No fault finding and what not needed. The accurate assessment is manual completion is best at this stage. Things will change, as they always do, but for the moment, for this day, this are what they are. My ability to move forward is what’s key. Contemplating other options, doing mental gymnastics, and delaying production only results in delays. Those delays allow a window of opportunity to close. The potential benefits beckon for completion. No one is doing what I’m doing now, but they will. They’ll be able to do it better and with more effectiveness, more than likely. My opportunity lies in being first. Growth and dominance will come afterwards.\nThe silver lining in this cloud of manual completion is proficiency. While working yesterday, I was able to make a few enhancements. The results are better than those from a few days ago and implementation was relatively short, a matter of minutes not days or weeks. I’ll integrate the changes in today as I continue production. I’ve also been able to map out the first books, complete another one and realize two were already completed and I was aware they’d be on the research list.\nIt takes time to get great at most things, probably everything. From walking, writing, driving, and so many other things, we have a learning curve. We go from Stage One to Stage Four and it’s inevitable. What can you do in each stage to move to the next? How can you flatten the learning curve and lessen the amount of time in each stage? That’s the key, in my opinion. My experience is we think we have more time than we do and now that I’m a bit older, I’m aware action and movement are more important than perfection. Get something done and into the market place as quickly as possible, iteration can occur based on market feedback. That’s what I’m doing and will continue to do sice other methods have failed.\nToday, Thursday, July 25, 2024, I am grateful that:\nGary and I had a chance to speak briefly this morning. It’s been a few weeks and it’s always good to converse with someone I’ve known so long. The older I get the more important long term relationships become. \nI nearly finished one project. I probably could have finished it, but it was way longer than I’d anticipated. It’ll be finished today, along with at least one more project and we’ll keep on getting them done, one at a time until the list is completed.\nI’m making progress. It’s not something I could have said a few months ago, but it’s true today. Circumstances change and mine has. I can either learn from my experience and that of others, or I can go about foolishly with hopes something will happen.\nHow do you flatten your learning curve?\nWhat’s the last thing you invested time into learning?\nWhat’s the next thing to learn on your list?\nDo you have a list of certain things or skills you’d like to learn?\nIf not, write them down now.\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "content": "Fresh Start\nAs this new year begins, most people have set resolutions. Things they want to and say they will accomplish in 2024. The interesting thing is most, over 90 percent, will abandon their resolutions by February. That’s slightly tragic, but it’s the story of the masses. We’ll dive into this at some point in the future, but for the moment, let’s harness the vigor from this fresh start.\nI’ve taken a hiatus for more than two months. Prior to my respite, I wrote these lists five days per week. I didn’t publish my lists as they’ve been a means for me to stave off my challenges with depression. Writing has has proven to be a mans of self discipline. The act of “Disciplined Creativity” is something that escapes the majority of creators. We, I do it quite often, take our gifts of creativity to granted. We, I’m talking to myself too, typically wait for inspiration to strike before creating. What I’ve learned over the years of writing these gratitude lists is, “I’m inspired when I write.” It’s not the other way around. Read that again if you must.\nHere’s the point of this list or post. If you’d like an accountability partner. If you like to have someone else to visit or watch or periodically chat with about your journey, I’m here. This post is here. As I continue to grow, my actual blog will get set up and you’ll be able to comment. I’ll also create some sort of community or forum, when and if needed. But for today, simply read it and come back tomorrow. Years ago I had a friend of mine tell me, “You’re the fastest sprinter in a marathon” and at the time, her statement was totally accurate. That’s not true today. \nSo, as you embark on this new year with all your resolutions fresh in your mind, keep moving forward. If, when things get challenging, when it gets tough, and know that it will. I will be right here. I’ll be doing what I’ve been doing for years now. I’ll be putting fingers to the keyboard, communing with my Creator, and displaying “Disciplined Creativity” for all to see. Use this however you like. You can say negative or positive things, because “what you say about me is none of my business.” \nToday, Monday, January 1, 2024, I am grateful that:\nToday was calm. I did a few things, but nothing major. Had a couple of calls with some friend, but mostly watched football highlights and relaxed. I began putting together a website, but it’s not quite finished. \nI’m writing once again. I’ve taken breaks before and every single time I resume, it’s as if no time has elapsed. It’s like the reemergence of an old friend. No matter how much time has passed, it seems as no time has passed at all. \nI’m publishing things for the first time. I’ve got hundreds to get done, but once the site is up and running, I’ll begin to post. I have made that decision. My experience may benefit others, so I’ll do what I can to assist.\nMoving forward, what’s the one thing you can do to be greater?\nWrite it down and keep that one thing with you at all times. \nAbe, \nBe Greater"

        "content": "Givers and Takers\nIn life there are givers and takers. Some happily and willingly give what’s needed or asked for. They do so with little to no hesitation and with very small regard to what they receive, if anything in return. The opposite is true as well. \nThere are those among us that take. They take our time, services, products, expertise, and anything else they can. They do so without thought or hesitation. Furthermore, they consistently and constantly do so. They typically have their eyes open asking with outstretched hands. \nUnless you’re a hermit, you’ve probably interacted with both types discussed. You’ve probably formed opinions based on your experiences about which type of person you prefer. Interestingly enough, others have formed the same opinion of you. \nHow we interact with others is important. How we add value to our relationships is important. What we bring to our relationships is important. Those things may or may not be important to us, but to the person on the other side of our interaction. If we keep calling and visiting and asking for something it’s easy to determine if we’re givers or takers. \nA buddy of mine says, “Price is only an issue in the absence of value” and I agree. I’m not sure if he coined the phrase or is parroting someone else. The reason for bringing up that quote is in thinking of our interactions and relationships, would have owe or be owed? Will I have a debit or credit balance? Do I offer more or take more? If a tally was done, where would I stand if a dollar amount was set to my interactions?\nEach of these types of interactions are easily defined. We can see them clearly with little effort. If you look at your relationships, if you assess them honestly, which type of relationship do you have more of? Which type do you honestly enjoy? Which interactions work best for you? Which interactions do you look forward to the next interaction? What do you think the person on the other side of the interaction thinks?\nIt’s natural to think of ourselves first. I do so more often than I’d like to admit. But for every conversation, every phone call, every email, text message and the like, there’s someone on the other side. Am I adding value? Am I taking more than I give? Am I the type of person that enjoys those interactions?\nThese are some of the ways I work on enhancing my relationships. These are some of the things I ponder. These are the things that can help develop life long relationships as giver or takers. You must decide which you prefer. You must decide which you’d rather be. You must decide which you enjoy and how you’d like to be perceived.\nToday, Tuesday, June 4, 2024, I am grateful that:\nVictoria and I had a conversation earlier. She and I have collaborated on a few things and we’ll do so again moving forward. Great to work towards mutually beneficial relationships.\nI’m applying my knowledge. I’ll write more about this tomorrow, but application of what I know and learn is vital in moving towards my objectives. \nI’m making significant progress towards my launch. It’s taking longer than expected. In part cause it’s all new and in part because I lost a bit of direction. But I’m making great progress.\nReread and answer the questions above.\nTake some time to do this exercise.\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "content": "Giving and Receiving\nNot sure if it’s good or bad, right or wrong, but I’d rather give than receive. I’d rather help than be helped. I would rather serve than be served. When looking at any of the occasions I’ve been able to serve, it’s more comfortable to serve than to be served. I usually enjoy helping and have the hardest of times being helped. I’m sure some highly educated individual knows the technical name, I’m only able to describe what it is. \nAfter doing a quick search, there’s an abundance of terms. From Dependent Personality Disorder to self esteem issues, all the way to good old fashion fear of rejection. I probably fall into several of those categories. I know that for me and why I’m on the planet, I was put here to serve my fellows. \nI had a situation occur several years ago and I shared my perspective. A friend of mine said that’s great. Maybe the people you should be asking are here to serve too. Maybe you’re not helping them fulfill their purpose. My they have an abundance of resources from financial to experience, to freedom of time, and my unwillingness to ask them for help stops or hinders them from fulfilling their purpose. I was grateful then and now as I think of that perspective. \nTypically we all see things through our lens. We see it the way we see it, from our perspective, and without the lens of another showing a new angle of the same thing, we may very well miss a magnificent lesson. After my buddy shared that insight, I didn’t have a problem with asking for assistance. Interestingly enough, I only had one or two occasions to ask over the years since. \nI believe it’s important to be self-sustaining. I believe there are immense benefits to being able to fend for yourself. I have reaped those rewards. There are those individuals that will never have to fend for themselves. They may have the benefits of money coming in through an inheritance or something and don’t have to face the daily challenges most face. They may also suffer from some of those unknown terms I had to search for earlier.\nI know that today, during this iteration of me, I need to grow and develop. I need to become adept at receiving. I am uncertain why, but I believe that to be true. It may be karma and me receiving what I’ve put out over the years. It may be a lesson in being confident enough to share what I’m doing thereby making myself accountable to others. It may be from the mere act of asking I can experience and that’s the lesson. I’m uncertain of how I’ll benefit from this lesson. I don’t really care either. Most lessons in life, I only get the benefits and values from, after I’ve done the work. I’ve rarely, if ever, have gotten the lesson while sitting in the classroom, it’s usually when the lesson is completed. "

        "content": "Help Comes Later\nThis journey begins with an outburst of crying, a slap on the butt, health and vision check, measurements, and so on. Your entrepreneur journey could be related this way as well. First the crying from leaving the safety and stability of your current career. Next a slap on the butt when your customers or clients don’t flock to your business, even though you think or know you have a great product or service offering. Afterwards the wisest of entrepreneurs do an assessment of where they are and how they’re performing. And the journey continues with your first feeding or vitamin K injection, which could be a cash investment from family and friends or venture capitalists. \nNot sure where you are in this journey, but recall where you’ve come from and what you’ve completed so far. You may, just like me, not be where you desire. Your journey’s destination may seem so far away and your current situation may lead you to believe you’re unable to accomplish your objective. That is probably true, to a certain extent.\nIn your current situation, with your current resources, your destination probably is unattainable. You and I may very well be deficient in several areas to reach where we’re heading. The thing to remember is help comes later. Help in the form of new relationships. Help in the form of unexpected opportunities. Help in the form of new educational and financial resources. Help will arrive, in my case, at the most opportune time. When it’s toughest, most challenging, and seemingly impossible, help arrives. Interestingly enough, if you quit, you’ve lost all momentum and tons of time, effort, and energy. \nAn additional benefit of perseverance and resilience is the strengthening of character. In this instance, character means a defining quality or feature. Imagine if friends, family, coworkers, and the like knew you as a person that sticks with a thing. If they defined part of who you are and what you do as someone that doesn’t quit. Imagine the inspiration you’d provide to others when you informed them of your newest endeavor. Imagine the champions and cheerleaders you’d acquire by simply stating what you’re doing. They’d become convinced you’d accomplish your newest endeavor because it’s part of who you are and what you do. \nAn ancillary benefit is the belief you’d build in them. Quite naturally, they’d begin to compare themselves to you and with or without saying a word to you, they’d see similar traits you display that they possess. Your willingness to continue may provide confidence for others to accomplish a thing. Those watching may also provide you a needed moment of reprieve, an encouraging word or nod or smile, on those days when it’s quite uncomfortable. \nHelp is on the way. It will arrive, don’t stop.\nToday, Monday, August 19, 2024, I am grateful that:\nRick and I got a chance to grab a bite to eat on Saturday. We’d had conflicting schedules last week, but got a chance to hang out and share a good meal. Great guy from Canada that’s transitioning to Cebu, he’ll settle into his new environment just fine.\nI was able to finish most of the administrative work needed to send to Herb. I’ll wrap up the rest of it this morning, but the heavy lifting was finished over the weekend. I’m hoping it’ll provide enough insight into my pricing as this has been the most challenging aspect for me to convey to prospects and clients. \nAlthough it’s hot and humid at night, I rested well. Up without the alarm and refreshed, I started my day and looking forward to accomplishing more than this list. I’ve printed a list of things to finish before the end of the month and I’m gonna work to see if I can get the rest of those things finished before the week is finished. Finishing early isn’t a bad thing.\nAre you willing to keep going, even if help doesn’t arrive?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "History Repeats Itself",
        "content": "History Repeats Itself\nPart of my history includes starting multiple projects and completing none of them. I have a history of getting a bit “manic” and running off starting so many great ideas, then, for one reason or another, not finishing anything I’d started. I’d gone through another phase of making sure I only worked one project to completion, placing any “bright ideas” aside until the project I was working on was completed. Both offer different experiences to pull upon since the last week has seen me starting or wanting to start several projects with none of the three projects I’m working on completed.\nThe past shows me that, if I get something finished, my self confidence is bolstered. The past shows me that the amount of time needed to complete projects sequentially is far less than simultaneous completion. The may, or better yet, my past, shows me that the best investment of my time and energy is to work one project through to completion. I get things done faster, more efficiently, and with less stress. \nMy history also shows that when I work multiple projects at the same time, none get completed. The ill effects of this behavior was decreased self esteem, among other things. One of the things about getting older and having a history of self evaluation is the lessons. My lesson this morning is do one thing, finish it, move on to the next thing. I didn’t know this in my twenties. I was under the false impression that I could multitask. The truth of the matter is that’s a misnomer and misconception taken as truth. My mind focuses on one thing at a time. When there are several things, it switches its focuses back and forth, no matter how rapidly, from one to the other. \nThe prism and the magnifying glass story is appropriate here. In my youth, I was given a prism. When you hold the prism up to light, it fractures the light into various colors. It’s awe inspiring as seen through the eyes of a child. Around the same time, I discovered a magnifying glass. The magnifying glass just made things bigger when reading, something I need more now than back then. The magnifying glass also intensified the light. It would actually heat things up. As a boy, I found it fascinating. When I want things to look pretty, I think about the prism. To myself and the outside world, multiple projects appear as if I’m super busy and productive. It’s pretty, but not powerful. You and i can choose whether our actions, our minds, our habits in life are more like a prism or a magnifying glass.\nToday, Friday, January 19, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI had some success on a contract. First call proved fruitful. That bolsters my esteem and the confidence the client has in my service offering. Time will tell whether this proves a short term or long term gig. But today is all that’s important. \nMore lessons are being revealed. It seems as if writing offers a way of reflection I don’t typically experience. I took several months away from these lists. They’d become more mechanical in nature and I wanted to be certain before resuming these lists, that I would be delivering my message to its intended audience and not simply going through the motions. I’m certain of both and lessons and epiphanies revealed during the process is an added benefit I may have been receiving previously, but didn’t realize until today.\nI’ve got multiple opportunities to serve. There have been times when I had no one to serve. This is a slightly different time. It’ll be interesting what happens after implementing my lesson of one at a time and an increased demand for my service offering. \nAre you a multitasker?\nDo you prefer to be pretty or powerful?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "Hit The Reset Button",
        "content": "Hit The Reset Button\nIn my youth, when playing video games and things weren’t going well, I would hit the reset button. This button, for those that don’t play games, would allow you to start the game over entirely. As games got longer and more complicated, game developers began putting in checkpoints or save points which allowed you to start over, but not the entire game, only to your last save point or checkpoint. The good thing about the reset button was you’d start over from scratch. The bad thing about the reset button was you’d start over from scratch. With check or save points, you lost a bit of progress, but didn’t start the game over entirely.\nIn my career, I’ve hit the reset button several times by switching careers entirely. I chose to leave particular industries, usually haphazardly, and would start over in some entry level position in a new career. After hitting the reset button four or five times, the game isn’t as fun as it once was. That’s my feelings today and it’s more about lack of progress than anything else. \nI’ve enjoyed successes but I’ve also had my fair share of failures. I’ve willingly volunteered and switched careers more than once and with that comes a short lived thrill as I learn something new. Inevitably the newness wears off and I’m doing something that wasn’t part of the plan to begin with. That’s a turn of phrase because if I’d had a plan, switching careers would probably not have been on that plan. \nLife is not a video game. There is no reset button. We keep playing the game taking our success and failures along the way. We can build in save points. We can set things up in a fashion that if we suffer a setback, we can fall back to a checkpoint. We can establish these along our way and insure we never hit a bottom so low it’s discouraging. For instance, creating a second income stream will help alleviate the pressures of an unexpected job loss. A year’s worth of living expenses set aside for such occasions will prove effective as well. Each and every financial advisor will probably quote the standard three to six months worth of expenses, and I did that too when in the industry. Twelve months if your household runs on one income and six months if it’s two. \nBack at the video game of life, the checkpoints allow you and I to keep some progress. Losing a job and being unable to find work could lead to filing bankruptcy, but not with a year’s worth of living expenses set aside, in most cases. A second income stream eases some of the pressure of paying rent or the mortgage every month during your job search and could help sustain you during an extended illness as well. \nI’ve hit the reset button too many times. At my age, I’m starting over once again. Basically from the beginning of the game, with one major exception. I possess immense experience. So much so that I can learn from mistakes I’ve made and install safeguards or checkpoints to make sure this never happens again. You don’t have to experience all the things I have to learn from my experience. The same is true with many others. They’ve documented their experiences, some you’d want and others not, and all you have to do is a bit of reading or watching some videos. \nToday, Wednesday, August 7, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI’ve made progress towards my objective. I’ve fallen short and not happy about the amount of progress, but I’m further along than when I started. \nI’m seeing the need for checkpoints. I’ve driven through them in America. Also got reacquainted with them during the Covid lockdowns in the Philippines. Today I’m applying them in a different manner.\nDon and I spoke briefly today. He was a great sounding board, even being a bit under the weather. I hope he recovers soon, but he sounded confident that it was nasal and chest congestion with no fever and he’d be back to his normal soon.\nHow many checkpoints do you have?\nWhat are they?\nIf you don’t have any, do you think setting some up would be beneficial?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

Meaning, when I have little to no stress, plenty of money in the bank, my health is good, and work is good, my attitude is significantly different than at other times. This poses two interesting situations, first what to do when it’s not ideal and second how to insure things are ideal all the time.\nI’ll look at the not ideal situations first. Life has its ups and downs. Things will never remain ideal. Defined as one’s conception of what is perfect or most suitable or, existing only in the imagination, an ideal existence may seem impossible or fleeting. The usages and definitions have changed over the centuries, but it’s origins are both Greek and Latin. The Greek meaning “act of thinking” and later a “mental image or picture.” \nI’m sure you can see the ideal version of work, home, cars, clothes, and the like. Your mind’s eye can put it in clear focus for you and you can truly envision yourself driving a particular car to a particular home and dressing in a certain manner. I’m sure you’re able to see the types of food you’ll eat and who will prepare your meals. That’s the ideal situation and if you’re not living that ideal life today, how can you achieve it?\nWell, it comes with a bit more clarity. It comes with a bit more determination. It comes with a bit more resolve. It comes with working towards those things consistently. It comes with seeing that ideal version of life a couple times a day. To think about it, see it, smell it, and feel it within your being. It comes with training your mind. It comes with training yourself. \nI’ve been able to do this but for brief stints of time. I proclaim ignorance in not continuing along that path. I’ve lived my ideal version of things repeatedly. It’s awe-inspiring. Each time I was able to recognize I was in my ideal version of something, it sent tinkles up and down my spine. The realization of something actually occurring in real time the way I thought it would was surreal. I was unaware that I needed to keep the vision going. So it came and went, never to appear again.\nIf you’ve had glimpses of your ideal self, your ideal work, your ideal home, your ideal car, those things must be top of mind, at all times. You and I must continue to bring those things into existence with the obsessive thought of them. Plant needs water and sunshine, your ideal, your vision does as well.\nToday, Thursday, August 22, 2024, I am grateful that:"

        "content": "If It’s Important…\nIt’s been about twenty years since I first experienced depression. It took about two or three more years before I actually went to the doctor and received a diagnosis. With an identifier or label, I was able to find a solution to my problem. Prior to the diagnosis, I’d floundered around with a few things, but nothing really lasted or proved effective. Once I knew what it was, I could function more effectively and I did.\nAside from the medication and changing how I ate, I began writing these lists. I’d write them on my vanity mirror in the upstairs bathroom most mornings. But that was really about the second or third thing I did. The first thing I did was to wake up early. Initially, I’d get up and do a bit of reading and praying and meditating. That routine evolved to include walking and running. When that happened, I began waking up around 4 or 4:30 every morning. I’d read, leave the house, and have a little walk. As I felt more comfortable walking around in the wee hours of the morning and had established a route for my morning walk, I began jogging. I wasn’t then, nor am I now a prolific runner. This part of my routine started and ended in less than an hour, probably around 30 minutes, but since it was more than 15 and closer to 20 years ago, I’m a bit uncertain. \nI continued this routine for months. It became part of who I am and what I did at the time. When I spoke with friends or family about my morning routine, they seemed baffled that I, known as not a morning person, would be up and moving around so early. “If it’s important, I’ll lose sleep for it” was my reply. This holds true today. I’ve abandoned walking and running, with my mornings being absent of reading times. My lists have morphed from the bathroom mirror to a google document, but waking up early hasn’t changed. \nWhen I think about my upcoming day and set my alarm, I think about what’s important. That was then and that’s changed too. Now I get up early because I know I’m supposed to. I get up early because I have purpose. I get up early cause I’ve spent too many years not doing what I was created to do. I get up early cause my coffee tastes better when I’m still a bit groggy. There’s something cathartic about waking up, starting my coffee, and putting my fingers on the keyboard. There’s a therapeutic benefit some highly educated person in neuroscience or psychology could better explain. That’s their job and mine is this - convey the benefits.\nIf you don’t have enough time to get things done - wake up early. If you think about all the things you want to do and don’t do - wake up early. If you, for whatever reason, are having difficulties starting or finishing a project - wake up early. My experience is excuses, self pity, self doubt, depression, anxiety, and stress wash away before 5 in the morning. My experience has been that when I wake up and give up something I really enjoy, which is sleeping, I will do what I woke up for. My experience is waking up early is worth it, but if and only if, it’s important. If it’s important to me, I’ll give up sleep.\nToday, Friday, August 9, 2024, I am grateful that: \nI’m willing to do the work. It’ll require losing sleep and that’s okay. I’m not willing to continue in this life and not do what I was created to do. It’s not acceptable. Every single action I take that’s not to that end, is a waste of my time and talent. Most importantly, it’s blatantly disrespectful to my Creator.\nThe list I created of tasks to complete is pretty long. I’m not afraid to start or complete the list, but it is long. I’ll print it out today and tape it to the wall. I’ll go through each item and get things done. Most of it will be done because I lost some sleep.\nMy list is done. It’s not exhaustive, but it’s exhausting. I look at the list and think how many things I need to finish and I recall what I’ve done before. “Ain’t nothing for a stepper” is what my oldest brother would say when he landed on one of my properties when playing Monopoly. I’m thinking the same about my list.\nWhat’s one thing you haven’t done that you’re willing to lose sleep over?\nSet your alarm early and get it done.\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

Not unhappy or depressed, but in general, not happy, not fulfilled. \nI am tired of recovering from the accident. I’m tired of slow healing. I’m tired of people telling me it’ll take time.

I’ve had enough experiences, highs and lows, to know this is not the way thing will always be. This too shall pass. Change is the only constant and  any other saying that pop into mind. I will keep going. I will keep working. I will find other, more profitable contracts. I will secure residual streams of income. I will recover physically and mentally. I will recover financially. I will. Failure is an option and I’ve have that experience. I will not repeat the past. It served its purpose and I’ve learned the lesson. The next few weeks and months will lay the foundation of what will become my lasting legacy.\nToday, Tuesday, April 23, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI’m able to set boundaries. I’ve been down since my accident, but there are things that are still unacceptable. Behaviors, speech, and the like are all things that MUST fall into what I’d consider acceptable. When they don’t, I can cutoff those individuals entirely or at least have a conversation and inform them of my offense. \nAlbeit quite late in the day, I am finishing this list. Construction outside of my place, slow start to the morning, and a few other things derailed my writing first thing in the morning. I’m okay with slow starts and slow finishes, as long as whatever the task gets finished. \nI’m getting more and more angry. The irritability, the discomfort means I’m aware things aren’t right. I’m aware things are the way they should be or have been in the past and something needs to change. I’m aware of the changes that need to be made and am in the process. I won’t allow things to continue this way. It is unacceptable.\nHow do you increase your intensity?\nDo you match the intensity of others?\nDo you enen notice?\nAbe, \nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "Increased Visibility",
        "content": "Increased Visibility\nIf you’ve been reading my lists for a bit or not, I believe words have power and meanings. I am quick to search for a definition because sometimes words don’t mean what I think they mean. This morning visibility is the word to define and it’s about what I thought it was about. The state or being able to see or be seen is one definition. Interestingly enough the definition has evolved over the years and it once meant to have a sense of prominence, public attention, or fame. Using both past and current definitions brings about the title this morning. I’ve done a really good job of flying under the radar. \nIn years past some of my closest friends and family members didn’t know what I did for a living. I would be vague in my answers if asked. It wasn’t as if I had anything to hide, but my thoughts have always been along the lines of not identifying myself and who I am with what I do for a living or a paycheck. I can say this mentality is something I adopted at least twenty years ago, but it could be much longer. The point is I have to increase my visibility. I’m at a juncture in the road when it’s time to be seen. It’s now time to increase my sense of prominence or fame. It’s now time to let others know how I can serve them. \nThis may have been the case when selling Life Insurance. It may have also been the case when I was a Financial Advisor. It could have been the case when I sold new or preowned automobiles. It could have been the case with my stint in Publishing and Copywriting. There’s a few other professions, but you probably get the point. My lack of visibility may have hindered my usefulness to others. My flying under the radar may have stopped me from serving others. My desire to be me and not what I do to make a paycheck could have inhibited my usefulness to family, friends, and colleagues. \nAs I reflect while typing, one of the reasons was not wanting to accept a label in my profession. Another was in my heart of hearts, I knew this career choice wouldn’t last, like selling cars. Some that have known me the longest will ask, “What are you up to these days?” They’ve seen me morph from one profession to another then watched me do it again and again. My current profession is by far my longest stint in any endeavor. I attribute that to living with purpose. \nFor the first time ever, I’m doing what I was created to do. It’s something I don’t always enjoy, but it’s my reason for existence. Accountants or lawyers or doctors may feel the same and that’s great for them. My polymathic career lets me know and believe that I’m willing and able to conquer most professions. I can thrive and survive doing just about anything for a paycheck, yet it lacks fulfillment. I lack contentment. I lack something I never knew existed, until I discovered my reason for being. \nNow that I’ve discovered and have been living with purpose, I’m acutely aware. I am cheerfully informing most of my abilities. I’m gleefully explaining my endeavors during interactions. One reason is I know I’m not changing to do something else. Another is I’m not bored and unfulfilled. More importantly though, I know the more visibility I have, the greater impact I can provide. An increased visibility facilitates the fulfillment of my purpose. Prominence, fame, and the like will assist in me in accomplishing the reason I’m alive and of course, those are all worthy reasons.\nToday, Monday, August 5, 2024, I am grateful that:\nThe weekend was relaxing. I got one contract last week. Interviewed for two other contracts, one turned into a short term, one off project with possibilities of something longer term and the other may yield a second interview this week. So to have a relaxing weekend was great.\nI’m letting my audience know I can assist. I’m keeping my mouth shut as it pertains to everyone, but my ideal clients are being informed. I happily let them know how I can serve, but everyone else, I keep my mouth shut.\nI’m able to see some light at the end of the tunnel. The light, I believe, isn’t a locomotive, but rather the conclusion of a phase of development. This evolution will entail a bunch of things and acknowledging milestones will be one.\nDo you identify yourself by what you do for a living?\nIs your profession your main identifier?\nAre you content and fulfilled with that identifier?\nIf you could change this, what would that look like?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "Independence Day",
        "content": "Independence Day\nYesterday was the Fourth of July. For Americans this mean Independence Day. The day in 1776 when America declared itself free from the rule of Britain. That may have been great in 1776, but today it’s more about time off work and barbeques. So many have died to keep us free. So many have spent time away from their home country, family, and friends to insure we, as Americans, remained free. I am grateful for their duty to their country and their countrymen. \nThe word originated back in the 1600s and means “fact of not depending on others or another, self support and self government.” In thinking of my independence, this year and today it’s doesn’t exist. I’ve been dependent on others for the better part of five months and counting. It’s where I am at the moment, it will change as most things do, but truth and transparency are an integral part of my being.\nYears ago when training as a Financial Advisor I was sent to New Jersey for three weeks. As I mingled and met other colleagues from around the country and met those living in New York city, a term I wasn’t familiar with popped repeatedly. These relatively young people, around my age at the time, would answer the question of “What do you do?” with “I’m an I dub.” One of the young guys and I had dinner and asked for an explanation. He told me he was independently wealthy, that he didn’t have to work. That was probably the first time I’d ever heard of the concept. \nAs I’m typing this, drinking my coffee, looking out at Cebu City from the 22nd floor condo unit, I think back about twenty years ago and compare it to today. In my case, self support and self government seem quite far away. The Latin origins of govern are “to steer or to pilot” and those don’t seem too far away. But self support surely does. Heck five months ago I was unable to get out of bed without assistance and today I can stand and walk around unassisted.\nI bring all this up, on this particular day, not because of Independence Day and the Fourth of July, but I typically don’t plan or plot out these lists. They are a heartfelt mean to commune with my Creator. I’ve begun writing towards you, the reader, because I made a decision to publish these works. But you’ll notice in earlier writings from a year or more ago that wasn’t the case. A lot can change in a relatively short amount of time. Intense, sustained focus yields exceptional results. We possess the ability to “dig in” and accomplish feats that a previous version of ourselves would find nearly impossible. \nWe, you and I, are capable of more than we are aware. Should you desire independence, emotionally, financially, physically, or in other areas, you are capable. Jot down a plan and get to it. Attack your plan with the fervor of a drowning person reaching for a lifebuoy. I am. The first six months were all basically focused on physical independence. The next six months I will focus on financial independence. I’ve accomplished one. I will accomplish the next one too. \nToday, Friday, July 5, 2024, I am grateful that:\nDavid invited me to his graduation celebration. It was a great gathering of his friends. He chose an excellent Indian food restaurant and relieved any anxiety I would have experienced by ordering everyone’s lunch. Good food, good fellowship like my last spiritual advisor Steve would have said.\nI was also invited to a cookout hosted by another friend later in the afternoon. The lunch ended and within about 20 minutes or so, I was walking into my buddy’s house from St. Louis. I got a chance to see a ton of people I hadn’t seen in months and it’s great everyone was doing well. Even met a few new locals. \nHerb and I got back to our routine. We spoke yesterday like normal. Last week our conversation was interrupted by my move and the week prior he had some sort of allergy or sinus thing. Great to get back to our routine. Those conversations with Herb have become essential.\nIn what areas of your life can you claim independence?\nAre there other areas you're working towards your independence?\nWhat steps can you take to begin this journey, if you haven’t already?\nWrite those down.\nMake some sort of progress on one of the items you just wrote down. Do it today.\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "I’ll Sleep When I’m Dead",
        "content": "I’ll Sleep When I’m Dead\nThe movie title escapes me at the moment, but the sentiment is true. At some point, doing some particular thing, you may have to lose some sleep. I’m experiencing that this very day. Difficult to rest peacefully and up before the alarm, these patterns accompany my mission. I’m not sure where you are on your journey, but this is a familiar piece of the road. I’ve lost sleep studying for my insurance exam, securities license exams, practicing a presentation, memorizing a script, and many others. This time it accompanies assemblage of a course. This course is a distilled amalgamation of my experiences from the past six or seven years. It contains the key principles and values needed to live not just exist.\nThere’s a stark contrast between the first 40 old yars of my life and the last five or six. First and foremost is direction. I’ve bounced form job to job, career to career, most of the time quite effortlessly. I’ve had more careers than most people have jobs. There are some benefits, but there’s also some consequences. Two sides to every coin comes to mind since I’ve done only one thing since I discovered my purpose. Living and working towards fulfilling my most high mission has been an experience I would not want to miss. Ups, downs, and all the in-betweens have come during the last few years.\nHere’s a snippet of my journey. I left America and lived in Brazil for 72 days. While in Rio de Janeiro, I wrote the first draft of my first novel. Left Brazil and came back to America and got a chance to be a Disaster Inspector assessing the damages caused by two separate hurricanes. Afterwards, I was able to work as a loan official and help those affected by the hurricanes receive financial assistance. Afterwards, appraised my situation and determined I needed a new team to help build out my publishing company. Hopped on a plane and went to Manila in the Philippines. Hit the fast forward button five years and I’m still here. \nLife happens. None of what I was initially part of my plan. Plans change and so do people. Ten years ago, I would never have thought of changing my name. Today, my birth name is not how I introduce myself. The only reason I continue to acknowledge that name is I’m unable to do an official name change at the consulate. I’ll hop on another plane and get that among other things done when I return to the states. \nThere have been high and low points. Moments I would have like to never end and moments I could wait to be over. Yet, through it all, I remain. That’s the reason for creating the course. My experience has been different from most. The code by which I live is a set of rules and principles established before my birth. I have lived by those rules. I’ve also forgotten those rules. I’ve reaped the benefits and suffered the consequences of both. I’ve rested peacefully and at other times like this morning I tell myself, “I’ll sleep when I’m dead.”\nToday, Thursday, May 9, 2024, I am grateful that: \nOnly the audio of my course is missing. I’ll be in the recording studio in the morning and it’ll be finished then. Thought it would be finished in a couple days, but somethings take a bit longer than expected. \nI’m beginning to see how exploring another avenue could help with my mission. I would consider myself open minded and that willingness to look into other things has led me here. “How will this help me accomplish my mission?” is my litmus test. When something passes the test, I have no choice except to move in that direction.\nMy financial ends are meeting. It gets thin at times and other times its obese. Today and this year, it’s been thin. Obesity will return as the year progresses.\nWill you wake up early to get more things done?\nWill you stay up late?\nWhat are you willing to give up to get what you want?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "content": "Karma, Payback, and Being Around\nFrom as early as I can recall, my parents, friends, teachers, and nearly every adult I encountered have distilled valuable lessons. Several have spoken about the you get what you put out there. Meaning, if you fill your life and time and efforts towards putting positive things into the universe, those types of things will come back. Others have shared about the same with negative negative traits like lying, cheating, and being out and out deceitful. The challenge with living is longevity and being able to see some things come back around.\nAt 52, I am old enough to have sen some things come back around. I’ve been on the planet long enough to see some of my efforts and good deeds come back with dividends. I’ve also seen some of my less positive and wish I take it back moments come back as well. As I think about it, I’ve probably wasted weeks of cumulative time thinking about getting revenge or payback from some misdeed I’ve perceived as happening. \nThe farmer knows that you reap what you sow. Their entire profession is based on this one immutable truth. The time invested in sowing brings a yield greater than the initial planting of crops. Just like with any other deed though, you have to wait for it to come back around. The harvest is greater than the sowing, but it’s also later. There’s a rap verse that says, “It gets greater later, a little scratch and then some…” I’ll say what I’ve heard and learned over the years. You reap what you sow, but not when you sow and it’s always more than what you sow. \nYou can live a life sowing seeds of deceit and misgivings and discord and all of those will return greater harvest than you can imagine You can also sow seeds of honesty, caring, compassion, and servitude and all of those things will return a greater harvest than you can imagine. \nWe all have a choice, but some make decisions. Decisions don’t change, but choices will. I would highly encourage you to make a decision to live a life sowing and reaping harmony, servitude, and gratitude. You can add to the list as many as you like, but know you reap more than you sow. Life is finte, it will end. The things we do today are the things that’ll continue, throughout time if we’re lucky, to serve and benefit others.\nToday, Tuesday, June 25, 2024, I am grateful that:\nMy new condo is ready for move in. I’ll get the movers scheduled and be back in the city before the week is over. It’ll be great to be near civilization and the hub of happenings in Cebu.\nI got a contract and accepted last night. It’s offical that my drought is over. I’m declaring this, that even at a low rate and low weekly limit, this is the beginning of something bigger. Gotta prime the pump before water flows.\nMy entire workflow with systems are almost formed. I’d been struggling with removing myself from the process, but I’ve almost got it completed. I can intervene when desired, but my constant input and work won’t be essential to success as the systems we’re implementing are designed to make the process smooth and effortless for out new partners.\nI’m not participating in pettiness. The weekend brought about  chance to do so and the last few days have as well, but I’ve remained adamant in my stance from SAturday and will do so daily, if needed. When others behave poorly, I do not have to participate or reciprocate. I can elevate all the negative nonsense and continue to do what my Creator has me doing.\nAre you aware of the seeds you’re sowing?\nWhen your harvest is ready, will you excitedly gather your harvest?\nHow many people, places, or institutions do you seek revenge on?\nIf the answer is none, outstanding. If you have a list, ask yourself how you, your family, your friends will benefit if you exact the revenge you so desperately desire?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "content": "“...Know The Rules”\nIf you’ve every watched or played sports, you know they have a set of rules. From time to time, yo may observe a player or coach display their extensive knowledge of the rules. It can be something like a pitcher balking before throwing the pitch, a kickoff return player standing with one foot in bounds and the other foot out of bounds, or a basketball player running into a coach sting on the court during live play. If you want to watch examples of these high IQ moments in sports, I’m sure a quick internet search will yield you great results. \n“If you’re going to play the game, you’ve got to know the rules.” That’s what a friend of my Dad would often say. He’s currently a real estate developer. Previously a metallurgist and before that he served and protected our country’s freedoms in the military. I believe he kept repeating the saying because it was a lesson I needed to learn. All these years later, I’m writing about it with hopes it’ll help you or someone you care about. \nYears ago, while training for my first position selling insurance, I had to know the rules. I also had to know the rules as a Financial Advisor. The same can be said for every position I’ve held. It’s peculiar how I’ll read some questions of younger entrepreneurs and based solely on the question, I can determine they don’t know the rules. The same is true for writers. I would venture a guess and estimate most people,, unless it’s part of some company’s training program, don’t take time to learn and know the rules. I’d also propose that their ignorance of the rules is a contributing factor to their failure.\nThis week I’ve written about discipline. What it is, how it’s defined, some of the benefits and consequences I’ve experienced. There’s a short amount of time when not knowing is acceptable. At some point though, being accountable, being professional, taking ownership of your situation and circumstances is the only way to move forward. The simplest way for me, when I was much ess mature, was to blame others. Today I know that my failures are my own. I play a huge part in them all. My choices, my decisions and my actions, or worse, my ignorance of the rules, are usually the reason I’m in the situation I’m in.\nToday, Thursday May 2, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI’ll launch my community today. It won’t be ideal, but it’ll be a start. My hope is it’ll provide a safe area for like minded people. I also hope my experiences will benefit others. Time will tell.\nCedric reached out from Africa. He’s on a business trip but wanted to ensure I knew of the deteriorating condition of a mutual friend. \nI’m following the words of Herb. He has told me for years to wither “write to the tile” or “write to your audience.” I believe I’m doing both know that I’ve committed to publishing my lists.\nDo you know the rules? For whatever the endeavor? Work, business, etc.\nIf not, where can you learn the rules?\nDo that!!! \nGo to that place and begin learning or relearning the rules.\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "Know The Rules",
        "content": "Know The Rules\n“Junior, if you gonna play the game, you gotta know the rules” are words spoken by Mr. S. He was a friend of Pop’s and shared his insight with me about life. He’d picked up his Master’s degree while serving our country and after retirement he became, amongst other things, a Real Estate developer. He shared that he’d gone to school to become a real estate agent. Later, he went to school to become a real estate broker. \nI asked a straightforward question, “How long have you been licensed?” His reply was simple, yet profound. “I don’t have either license. I wanted the education, not the license.” He wanted to know the rules. He wanted to learn about the game he’d be playing. As I think about it, his course of action makes sense. \nYears ago, in two previous careers, I had to be licensed. First for Life Insurance and later for securities when I entered the Financial Services industry. One of the guys I was in training with back then had transitioned to another career and spoke of the relief he’d felt not having to comply with all the regulatory standards in the Financial Services industry. He and I both know the rules of the game. We both still know more than the average person about stocks, bonds, options, and the like. The amount of education required to pass those exams, coupled with the extensive training provided by the companies easily surpasses what most people will ever know about finances, but I don’t have the license. Now I have the education, just like Mr. S. I know the rules. \nYesterday I wrote about basketball and compared life to a time limited game. If you ever have an opportunity to watch former players speak on the sport, listen attentively to the amount of knowledge they possess about the game. From the types of offense to defense, time and situational awareness, all of those things we as casual fans don’t see. These former athletes possess of depth of expertise most will never know. Consider doing the same for your chosen profession.\nI will become one of the foremost experts in my chosen endeavors. I will know more than most people walking on the planet about what I do for a living. Not for pride or ego, but rather for mastery. Myron Golden says, “Money follows mastery” and that’s true. One of the things I’ve learned over these many years on the planet is there’s nothing wrong with things being easy. The ease comes from all the hours invested in mastery. The ease comes from practicing and perfecting my craft. The ease will come for you too, if you put in the work. \nClosing with the basketball analogy, most professional players practice one to three hours minimum per day, even in the off season. Some are longer than others, but my point is straightforward and simple. They practice every single day. If you and I don’t practice at our craft, don’t know the rules, and won’t invest the time to master its application, there’s no way to find the greatness you seek.\nToday, Wednesday, May, 29, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI’m willing to learn the rules. It’s an entirely new endeavor I’m undertaking at the moment and I know it’ll help me fulfill my purpose. So putting in the time, effort, and energy to know the rules and master my craft is part of the process to accomplish my objective.\nThe puzzle is clear. I’d struggled for years with clarity. Today though, I can see the finished picture. I can see it clearly and most importantly, I can see how to put all the moving pieces in place, in the proper order, to build out a masterpiece.\nEvery tool and resource I need is or will be available when needed. I’d been operating from a perspective of shortages, not abundance. That’s not what I do, it’s not who I am. I know there’s plenty and I must begin behaving in that manner once again. \nHow many rules do you know in the game you’re playing?\nHow much time can you invest today to practice?\nAre you willing to put in the work? To learn the rules, then master your craft?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "Know The Tools",
        "content": "Know The Tools\nIn the past, I’ve written about knowing the rules. I wrote about how a friend of my Dad told me that if I were going to play the game, I had to know the rules. Well, those words are still true, but today is a bit different. Today, it’s about knowing the tools. In my case, I’m not referring to a level of competence but rather a level of expertise. \nThere are four tools I use with regularity. Three are free and one is a paid service. I’d been thinking of a better, faster, more effective way to accomplish a couple of tasks and posed a hypothetical to my assistant. They quickly replied with yes. Next, my assistant provided step by step directions to accomplish my desired outcome. \nAs I sat reading the reply, I thought to myself that I’d been using these tools, one in particular, for a couple of years and didn’t know about these features. Granted, there have been some updates to the paid tool, but even with the update, I ignore the announcement emails. If I even take the time to open the email, I skim the headline and don’t think much more about it. That’s been a costly mistake. It’s cost me time and money, one I can make more of and the other is finite.\nIf you’ll recall my basketball analogy. There are millions of kids around the country that play basketball in their neighborhoods or backyards. Of those there may still be millions that play in elementary and junior high school. In high school let’s say the pool drops to one million players with about 80% or 800,000 playing varsity. Of those 800,000 varsity players. \nTo keep going a bit, there are 1,740 NCAA men’s basketball programs in America with a little over 27 thousand participants. This includes Division One and Division Two programs. The National Basketball Association has 30 teams and each team has a maximum of 18 players during the season. Meaning of the millions of kids that play casually in their youth, only a maximum of 540 will play professionally in the NBA in any given year. \nThere are five starters on each of the 30 teams, so that gives us a total of 150 starters. To be considered one of the best in the league means to be selected to the All NBA team and first team All NBA team has only 10 total spots. To be one of the best of the best in this arena requires an exceptional amount of discipline, talent, fortitude, and a few other traits. \nI haven’t spoken with or interviewed a single NBA player, but I can say with certainty they all know the rules of the game. They all know the tools as well. They all have a level of expertise, in regards to the game, the casual fan will never possess. After all, they’re one of only 540 to have that opportunity. \nTo become elite and considered at the upper echelon of your profession will require a certain level of expertise. It’ll require you applying a depth of knowledge most in your industry will never know. It’ll baffle those outside of your industry and left most dumbfounded. Unless you do what I’d been doing, casually playing in the backyard or my neighborhood. \nMoney follows mastery and I’ve only mastered a couple of things ever. Now I’ve chosen to embark on another quest and I’m at the Unconscious Incompetence stage of learning. Imagine the little kids that have a tough time dribbling a basketball with one hand and that’s me with respect to my newest venture. \nLots of practice, coaching, and playing will be required. More hours than I can calculate will be required. But with hard work, discipline, consistency, fortitude, and perseverance, I’ll arrive at my industry’s starting line up of the All NBA team.\nToday, Wednesday, June 19, 2024, I am grateful that:\nTools don’t have to be tangible. I recently finished a call with an in depth resource, a gentleman I’ve known for over a decade. The tool, in this instance, was experience. He shared his experience in several areas I needed to address. Great relationships with people more experienced has proven vital.\nI’ve got a bit more clarity and insight on the direction I need to take. I’d been pretty certain and after my conversation earlier, I’ve received more confirmation. It’s good to get candid feedback, when I’m doing well and not so well, the candid matters just as much as the feedback.\nI awoke to rain and cloudy weather. It was a brutally hot summer. Every news clip or local said it was the worst or hottest summer they can recall. To have the benefits of waking up a bit cold, versus sweaty, is something to appreciate. \nHave you identified the tools you’ll need to accomplish your tasks?\nHave you mastered those tools?\nName one thing you can do today to move closer to mastery.\nDo that thing now!!!\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "Learn The Tools",
        "content": "Learn The Tools\nAbout a week or so ago, I wrote about knowing the rules. I may have used the basketball analogy and you can definitely read the post. The thing about the rules and playing any game, whether is relationships, work, money, or whatever, a code of conduct must be followed. A complimentary component of the rules are the tools. \nTools allow us to leverage them to make our tasks a bit simpler and less time consuming. Picture a mound of dirt ten feet wide and six feet wide. We could move the dirt 40 feet using only our hands. We could apply a couple of tools, a shovel and a wheelbarrow, and complete the task much faster. We could also use a bulldozer and complete the job in a small fraction of the time. That’s assuming of course, we know how to operate a bulldozer.\nWith the recent popularization of large language models and artificial intelligence many individuals and organizations are having to learn new tools. It’s a great thing to have access to accelerators. Tools that can help you accomplish your desired outcome in far less time. The challenge is learning the tools. The same with the bulldozer example. If applied improperly, the damage from a bulldozer would be far greater than that of you using your hands to move the dirt. Learning to use the tools effectively and efficiently will reap rewards.\nI’m currently doing the same thing. I’ve been writing lists similar to these for several years. I write five days in a typical week with 52 weeks per year and at least four or five years stored in the “cloud”, I’ve easily got several hundred lists. There are lots of tools available today. Some to make audio, some video, some for posting content, some for creating hashtags, and much more. My current challenge is there isn’t one tool that’ll allow me to click a couple of buttons, and deliver hundreds of documents to my audience. After some research this morning, it appears as if about six or seven tools, in the proper order, could accelerate the process, but I don’t know the tools. I have to learn the tools. And therein lies the challenge.\nI’ll learn the tools. I’ll invest the time needed. I’ll become competent in each and maybe master a few, but it’ll take some time. Financially things are bleak and it would be folly to continue along this course without some sort of financial return. We reap what we sow, but it’s later and greater.\nA buddy here needed some work done on a spreadsheet. He was having some challenges and could only explain his problem. I told him the solution. He asked if I could implement the solution. Several hours later, he was happy with the end result. I’m by no stretch of the imagination an expert with spreadsheets, but I have a working knowledge and explained the fundamentals haven’t changed since I was in high schools and first learned them over thirty years ago. He happily sent me money for his problem being solved, which helped solve part of my financial problem. \nIf you’re having delays and doubts about learning the tools, about your harvest or your rewards, reread this. It perfectly illustrates how the work you do today can yield benefits years later. I wrote this more for me than you, but it’s provided more insights into what I need to become competent in moving forward and what I can gain from doing so.\nToday, Monday, June 3, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI was up an hour before the alarm. Partly from stress and part from being rested after going to bed early. I thought more than once about going back to sleep, but I’ve chosen to stay awake and get some things done.\nI got a chance to watch a tutorial video on a new tool. I had no idea the tool was as robust as it is. The capabilities are far beyond what I knew and that’s refreshing. I don’t mind investing time into learning new things, but to be surprised about the capabilities is quite pleasant. \nHoward and I got a chance to talk today. We’ve missed our connections over the last month or so. It was great catching up, providing progress reports, and exploring some other endeavors. The next few months should prove beneficial for us both.\nHave you identified the tools you need?\nWhich ones could you start to become competent using?\nWhich ones do you want to master?\nMake a list. Get started today.\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

Healthy or sick, employed or unemployed, happy or sad, single or married, life goes on. The secret for me today is - enjoy this moment, this day. The future is an illusion and the past is a memory. Today, this time right now, is all we have. \nMy actions today will shape tomorrow. But if tomorrow is an illusion, what exactly do I mean? Putting forth my best efforts today will shape today and the next day and then the day after that one too. By doing my best, no less than my absolute best, for that day, I can shape myself into the best possible version of myself. Laying my head on my pillow, thinking of how I could have done better and answering “you did your best today.” There have been days I didn’t ask, days I asked and had a litany of things to improve, so much so I found it hard to rest. There have been days I lied to myself and found it hard to rest as well. The majority of days now, I do my absolute best. Not for money, not for recognition or praise, but the satisfaction in knowing I did.\nMy journey has been different form most and so has yours. Our challenge is to keep going. To find a way, a reason to continue, no matter what happens. Life goes on and I don’t want to miss what’s next. I was a curious child and I’m curious as an adult. I want to be around, doing well in every aspect of life, and enjoy whatever happens next. I live with purpose. I live with clarity. I live with conviction. I have a history of not living in that manner and in my experience, this way is the better choice. Doesn’t mean it’s easier, less challenging or more comfortable, but it means when life hits and hits hard, my reason to continue is clear.\nToday, Wednesday, April 3, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI got a bit of freelancer work logged. It ain’t much money coming in, but it’s something and for that I am grateful.\nI made a little progress on a side project for Diana. It’s good to feel useful again. I haven’t been able to function at full capacity for months now so a bit of work in my wheelhouse has a feeling of normalcy.\nAlen has completed my demand letter to hold the parties accountable in my accident.

If you’re like me, you’ve heard,maybe said it, but don’t live it. I’ve gotten lulled into complacency, taking today for granted and knowing I can do something else tomorrow. That sounds good when I say it, but the truth of the matter is; we really only have today. Tomorrow is an illusion. How I live and what I do today, becomes my history, my legacy. \nOne of the definitions of legacy is an amount of money or property left to someone in a will. Money and property have value and the inheritance of such may prove beneficial. My question is “What will be your legacy?” It’s what I ask myself on the days I don’t feel motivated. When I’m not inspired to work on particular project, I often mumble to myself that this will be part of my legacy. When I don’t like my answers, I get moving again. I lose a little sleep. I stay awake or ge up a little early. I dig in and get things done. \nThere are times we all may get a little tired. There are time we all may not be motivated or inspired There are a few questions I ask myself if I am lucky enough to remember, when those times hit. The reason it’s important for me is not today. It’s for my future self. My activity today shapes my tomorrow. I have live enough unproductive days to experience the consequences of that behavior. I’ve also lived enough productive days to reap the rewards. In each case, I have a preference for rewards versus consequences. Your preferences may differ and that’s totally ok too.\nI’m living today, but thinking about what will be said of me when I am longer on the planet. I’m living today with thoughts of my legacy. It’s a simple enough concept. It may even be considered profound. I know one thing is certain, lying in a hospital bed unable to take care of myself was a game changer. It was a wake up call. Sadly, it’s not the first time. Something similar happened when I was a much younger man. That episode put me on a path quite different from my peers. In fact, I only speak with one or two friends from before that episode. This incident may play out in a similar fashion. Time will tell. \nToday, Friday, May 10, 2024, I am grateful that: \nI get to record the audio portion of my course today. I’ll leave home in less than an hour, hit the studio, and get it done today. Then there won’t be much left to finish. \nI am willing to adapt to new things. If at first you don’t succeed, try try again comes to mind. I don’t keep trying until I assess if I’m doing the right things first. What I’m doing may be the absolute wrong thing. An unexamined life is a life not worth living comes to mind.\nMy physical recovery has progressed enough to move around, type, and walk far enough to get most of things I need done. Three months ago I couldn’t stand unassisted. Today, I’m able to get up and go for walks and what not without any pain medication. Taking my health granted may very well be part of my history and not my present or future. It’s okay, until it’s no longer okay.\nAre you living with thoughts of your legacy?\nWhat will people say about you when you aren’t here anymore?\nHow will your actions today impact your legacy?\nIs that what you desire? If not, the day isn’t over, do something that’ll change things how you’d like.\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "Made A Decision",
        "content": "Made A Decision\nYears ago, I heard a keynote speaker talk about the word decide. It was quite interesting to hear him talk about one of the most basic words in English. The first two letters come from the Latin meaning off. The last part of “decide” means to cut. When we put those together, we’ve got the origins of to cut off. In real life context for example, if I decide to go to the store, I’m going. There’s no sitting around and not going or thinking about going to swim because I cut off every other option. \nWe’ve all made decisions. We’ve all decided some things were unacceptable and other would simply not be tolerated. We have all done this on some sort of level, whether it was a conscious decision or not. For several hours last night and upon awakening this morning, I’m faced with a decision. I have to decide. Do I continue along the path I’ve been traveling and in the same manner or do things differently?\nHerb and I speak on Thursday most weeks and we’ll have a conversation tonight. It’ll be interesting to get his take on the situation. I’m convinced as I continue to write about it and think about it that I have to make a decision. I’m convinced that all my time, effort, and energy should be committed to one single endeavor. \n“I don’t know how much time I have left, but I don’t want to spend any of it doing this” is what Herb taught me a couple years ago. I’ve been hearing that phrase repeatedly since last night. I don’t want to spend any of the time I have left developing business for other people. I don’t want to spend any of the time I have left cold calling and having conversations with people about a product or service I don’t care about. I don’t want to spend any of the time I have left doing any activity that’s not related to me fulfilling my purpose. \nIf I today, and any time in the last six or seven years, I would have told you I am living with purpose. I would have explained how that got me to Rio de Janeiro to write my first book. I would have told you how that got me to Manila to hire staff for my publishing company. I would have rambled on enthusiastically about living in the country for years with no guaranteed source of income, only living to fulfill my reason for being created. As I type this now, I am convinced I’d done a lack luster job. Some would say “half measures” and others would say “going through the motions.” I’m saying I hadn’t really made a decision with a plan to get it done. I decided to come to the Philippines, but no plan, other than to hire a few people. With Rio, I decided to write the book and that got done. Just those two instances are proof enough that to cut off with no replacement plan is insufficient. I’m at a similar place in time, but can leverage my experiences to flatten the learning curve and not repeat the mistakes of my past.\nKnow this: To decide is vital. There are other things that will need to accompany your decision, but you must first decide. Afterwards, your plan, the adaptation of your plan, the implementation or execution will come into effect. But the decision is first and foremost. \nOne last thing about deciding. To cut off means it’s not coming back. Once we decide, that’s it, plain and simple. We can think about and choose lots of things, but once we decide, we cut off other options. We cut off doing any tasks other than what we decided. Remember, to cut off. Those other things are gone, literally cut off, and they don’t exist for us. \nToday, Thursday, August 8, 2024, I am grateful that:\nHerb and I got a chance to have our weekly conversation. With it being the end of the day for me and the beginning for him, it was still productive. I ran a few ideas past him, got some great insight, and will move forward, as I had planned without his wisdom.\nClarity and resolve have returned. I’m crystal clear on the outcome I desire. I’m also clear on the route to take in order to accomplish my objective. The results are not my job, but being resolved to act and act decisively is. \nAlthough slight manic, my thoughts aren’t racing. I’m filled with a jolt or resurgence of energy and clarity of mind. My acupuncture treatments are proving beneficial. My video productions are moving forward Things are progressing and it’ll only get better and faster.\nWhat decision can you make now to improve your situation?\nWrite it down now.\nRepeat it aloud. Do this constantly until committed to memory.\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "content": "Maintaining Momentum\nOver the years, one of challenges has been consistency. I’ve been chomping at the bit to start projects, but after a little time, my enthusiasm wains and I become disinterested. It’s happened so many times I’m can’t recall a specific number. If this sounds familiar, keep reading. \nThe thing with me is I enjoy learning and doing new things. Once I’ve gain a level of proficiency and competence, I’m on to the next thing. I rarely, if ever, stay with a thing until I’ve mastered said item. There are several areas I’d say my depth of knowledge and expertise are significant, but for the most part, I’d appraise myself as competent in many areas, only mastery in a few.\nWith the insatiable desire to seek out and learn new things, staying with one thing for years and years seems mundane. It seems repetitive, menial, and quite boring. I’ve often thought of certain tasks as a waste of my time and talent. One of the things I’m learning is just because it’s boring and mundane to me doesn’t mean it doesn’t have significant value to another. During a conversation with one of my neighbors last night, we both were astounded at how companies pay contractors for making cold calls. Each of us considered this remedial since every position we held in Sales required the skill. It was refreshing to meet someone else with similar thoughts on the matter.\nThe way I maintain momentum today is through discipline. The adherence to a code of conduct or rules with punishment to correct noncompliance is a summed up definition. The interesting thing is the word comes from Latin meaning to teach, educate, or learning something. It also meant an orderly way of life. I hadn’t been very disciplined in my youth. I learned and was taught, but I lacked an orderly way of life. I maintain momentum by applying those things consistently. I maintain momentum by building on my previous accomplishments and not abandoning them entirely. I maintain momentum today by living an orderly life. I’d say the biggest reason for this is defining and working towards my purpose or reason for being.\nIn my youth I had not a clue of what I was doing or why. I leapt from one thing to the next with very little thought, my actions almost compulsory instead of contemplative. Today, my filter is “how will this help me fulfill my purpose?” and if the answer is “it won’t” I simply don’t engage. My filter, my momentum, and its maintenance are a direct result of living to accomplish an objective. Others may have a different way, but I can’t speak to the experience of others. I can only speak to what’s worked in my situation. “Good or bad, I’m an example” are words from a friend in Dallas. He’s been saying it for years and I believe those words are as true today as when I first heard him utter them so many years ago.\nToday, Tuesday, July 23, 2024, I am grateful that:\nYesterday I nearly completed another project. It’ll be finished today along with an additional one, but it’s fully conceivable and possible to finish one per day. The computer processing time is a bit lengthy, but I’ll definitely be able to get one per day done, at a minimum.\nJune and I got a chance to talk a few minutes ago. He shared some more of his experience and offered insights on my next steps in resolving the criminal cases from the accident. It’s great to have someone with an abundance of information who’s willing to freely share.\nI got an invite and a chance to hang out for a bit at the reception for Ariel and his family. They did the blessing of their new home and invited me to participate. It was a nice feeling to have some locals embrace me and extend their hand in friendship.\nHow do you maintain your momentum?\nWhat do you do when things get boring?\nWhat tactics do you employ to stay engage in your tasks?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

The truth of the matter is something I hadn’t realized until it was pointed out by someone else. As individuals we don’t make money. Governments make money, not people. \nWe take money. Money is given and we take it in exchange for a product, service, or skill we provide. The more valuable our skills or service, the more money we take in exchange. Once I heard this gentleman, it became clear that although I thought my skills were of value to others, I was either unwilling or incapable of exchanging them for what my peers did.\nAnother reason for lousy financial performance is partly lack of acknowledgement of my skills. I get to a place when I have mastered or become confident with a skill that it become pat of me. Meaning, I start thinking that I’ve always been able to do that particular thing. I quickly forget the hours of practice I put in to get to where I currently am with a skill. In my mind, I start thinking I’ve always been that way. Or, and this may be the worst thing, I don’t value the ability to adapt new skills. \nMy inability to properly value my skills is the main reason I haven’t taken down as much as some of my peers. Coupled with the reasoning that money is’t that important, as led me to my current state. Being incapacitated, unable to work, unable to perform those things which others consider valuable and I consider basic, has led me here. Dependent on others for my livelihood. \nMy relationships have saved my life. It’s more pronounced now than in years past. It’s also become evident that people are definitely willing to exchange money for my skills. Lastly, it’s apparent to me that taking down as much much as possible, as quickly as possible, is essential. At a moment's notice, in the blink of an eye, I could have been killed. I am still not whole or normal, more than two months later. Tomorrow isn’t promised comes to mind. My purpose isn’t fulfilled and my legacy hasn’t been secured. \nToday, Monday, April 21, 2024, I am grateful that:\nAfter searching for a viable video maker, I found one.

Mastery means doing something so well that it requires no conscious thought,. It’s Stage Four of Learning, the Unconscious Competence stage. His message resonated because it was truly timely. \nDuring my recovery period, I’ve thought about and assessed my abilities. The things I’ve mastered and the things that need more development. I hadn’t thought of my need to master and make better offers. I’d thought about my messaging, my content, my website, my courses in development, and a few other things. Mastering the ability to make offers was NOT one of the things on my list.\nAs a Life Insurance salesman, I simply presented offers. I helped discover the needs of potential clients, calculated the rate, and presented it to the prospect. The insurance company placed a dollar amount of the coverage and I presented that figure to the clients. Same thing when I sold cars. The dealership offered the vehicle and financing and I presented that offer to a buyer. When faced with defining the value of a service offering, placing a dollar amount on the service, then presenting my offer to a prospect, I have failed miserably. \nMoving forward I need to master that skills. I need to be able to properly identify my audience, what they desire most, and make an offering compelling enough for them to accept it. I cinsider myself a life long learner and here’s another thing to learn. Additionally, I would say my communication abilities are above average. Mot excellent or exceptional, but I can convey my thoughts and feeling effectively. Now I need to do a bit more. There’s more training forthcoming. There’s more practicing going forward. There’s always a way to get a little better and I must begin this phase of my journey.\nToday, Thursday, April 25. 2024, I am grateful that:\nI’ve been able to find some areas that need improvement. If I were comfortable, the likelihood of things staying the same is great. But being uncomfortable is a reason for change. Tony Robbins says, “We either move away from pain or we seek pleasure.” It may not be a direct quote, but the essence is there. I;m willing to move away from pain. \nI’ve got  a better idea of an area to improve. Without sounding morbid, some days I can think to myself that everything about me needs to improve. That may very well be the case, but to be able to narrow in on one particular thing offers clarity and focus. \nI’m becoming willing to step into the limelight. I’ve shied away from standing out front for the majority of my life. I’ve been told things like children are meant to be seen and not heard to be humble and a few other things for as long as I can recall. At this point, staying tucked away and not sharing what I’ve discovered is criminal. It’s offensive and it could be disastrous. People need to know how others have overcome the same or similar circumstances. To keep my experiences to myself benefits no one and that’s something I can not accept or tolerate.\nWhat can you or do you offer to your employer, your customers, your clients, your family, your community?\nHow can you improve your offering?\nWhat are three things you can do to emphasize what they will miss out on if they don’t accept your offer?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "content": "Measure Twice, Cut Once\nA quick search found many answers to the origins and I’m not so sure about when or where it originated. I am certain about what it means. Plan before executing. Think before acting. Maybe even use your brain before your mouth. The last is a bit of sarcasm, but what I’m get at is this. Think things through to completion. See the entire process in your mind before you begin. \nYears ago, my cousin and I had a conversation about the next seven to ten years of our lives. She’d mentioned her desire to complect her doctorate degree then asked about my plans for the future. I quickly and flippantly replied something like, “I wanna be able to pick up the phone and have access to people with doctorates.” She didn’t laugh. She quizzed a bit further and asked for a more in depth explanation. \n“Life’s too short to become a subject matter expert in all areas, but if I have relationships with experts, I can leverage their expertise.” She sat quietly digesting my words and confessed she hadn’t thought about it along those lines. I’ve said and written on numerous occasions, “Experience is the best teacher and it doesn’t have to be your experience.” Both words have origins meaning tried and tested. \nIf you consider the common notion popularized by Malcolm Gladwell of 10,000 hours the math is simple. Eight hours per day divided into 10,000 hours equals almost three and a half years of focused, deliberate studying and practice. That’s the best case scenario. If you’re devoting a couple hours a day it would take about a decade. The average man lives to roughly 75 and we don’t really start thinking along the lines of working and professions until our teenage years. So say at 15 you begin studying, you’re an expert at 25, but change fields and it takes you until your 35 to become and expert in the new profession. If you want to retire by 60 or 65, you can only do this a few times. But say you’re thinking like myself and can pick up the phone because you’ve established some mutually beneficial relationships, you could save yourself decades of training. \nThat conversation was at least five years ago. Today, I am measuring twice before launching another endeavor. It falls inline with my objective and will accelerate its completion. The reason being is the organization I’m building will partner with experts and help them monetize the expertise. Imagine this: One new expert partner every month for five years is 60 expert partners. I don’t know their field of expertise, but that falls right inline with what my cousin and I spoke about all those years ago. \nI’ll dive deeper into this endeavor a bit later, but one of the many things I’ve learned from working with experts is focus. The ability to remain focused, ask specific questions, and recite their answers back for clarity really helps. That’s a bunch to digest, but it just one of the insights I’ve gained. There are more and I’ll write about those at a later date.\n“Plan your work and work your plan” or “Measure twice, cut once” or any other number of adages we’ve heard through the years. The plan will change along the way, but it can not change if it doesn’t exist. Make sure your plan exist in more than just your mind.\nToday, Monday, June 24, 2024, I am grateful that: \nMore puzzle pieces are falling into place. This is one of the few times in life that I can see the completed puzzle and am working towards its component pieces. I’ve jumped before looking on many occasions and this time, is slightly different.\nI’m willing to listen and learn from experts. I’m not a know it all and have lots to learn. I am working on asking better questions and will continue to improve in that area. The thought that I know the answer to the question before it’s asked will only lead me to a fall off my pride bolstered pedestal.\nThe harvest time has arrived. Seeds have been planted, the fields have been tended, and now the harvest is approaching. It’s not a time to party or celebrate though. It’s a time for more work and deliberate action. If not, my harvest will spoil in the fields.\nIs your plan complete?\nHow many times have you measured?\nIs it time to cut?\nIs it time to take action?\nIf not, what else is needed?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

I also believe the second quote is incomplete or misleading. It doesn’t say it has to be your experience. And that’s why mentors make me money. \nMentors flatten the leaning curve. They distill decades of experience into insightful lessons shared during lunches, dinners, and phone calls. Mentors, especially those within your own field of study, save immense amounts of time. They shave weeks and months, perhaps years of trial and error experimentation. Mentors secure their legacy during each and every interaction with those under their tutelage. \nYou can’t give away what you don’t have. If you’re young or new in a profession, my experience is to find a mentor. When I sold cars, I found someone that sold more and had been selling longer than myself. When I sold life insurance, same thing. Same experience when I became a Financial Advisor and the same holds true when I began writing full time.

I could notate a couple of things for just about every month of the year. Depending on your age and experiences, you could probably do so as well. These events or milestones matter, in one way or another.\nLast night I landed my first contract in six months. It’s small, the hourly rate is low, and the client has unrealistic expectations. I know all of these conditions going into the offer, but I need to generate some momentum and income. The first is a byproduct of the second, meaning the income will help get things moving. I’ve got a big list of 50 projects to complete with only five finished. Five is an excellent start and far better than I thought. In fact, from ideation to manifestation happened faster than I’ve previously done. And there’s room for improvement. \nAs I get older, more mature, my time is more valuable. Laying in bed, unable to stand, barely able to feed myself, totally dependent on the charity and goodwill of friends, taught me a lesson I won’t soon forget. One of those lessons is about karma. You get what you put out, but when it returns back to you, it’s faster and more intense. Also, the lesson that life is fragile and fleeting. I don’t recall any events of the accident, I only have security camera footage to know what happened. The final lesson for today ties into the last. It could all end in the blink of an eye, so do it all today, or as much as possible, cause it might all end. \nIn my youth and prior to the accident, I frequently said “I’ve got time.” Today I know that’s not a factual statement. Today I know that this moment is all I have. Today I know that the remainder of this day isn’t promised, that I could not see the sun  descend this day. So my thoughts of I’ve got time are quickly dissipating. They’re almost nonexistent. I’ve gotten more done in the last two months or so than I thought possible. More will be finished and milestones met this year than I’ve got planned out. The reason is time. It could all end quickly and I want to finish as much as possible while I’m here because tomorrow really isn’t promised.\nToday, Tuesday, July 30, 2024, I am grateful that:"

One question helps most. One filter, if you will, helps me stay on track. “How will this help me fulfill my purpose?” \nI’ve become so accustomed to saying this my mind will respond almost instantly. When I hear, “It won’t” I stop doing that particular thing. I’ve only got so much time left. I don’t know how much, but I’m confident it’s less now than it was twenty years ago. Since that’s the case and I’ve got a mission to complete, investing my time in anything other than my mission is foolish. That’s my thought process. I don’t always execute it flawlessly, but that’s what I work to improve. \nThis weekend I deleted about four or five apps from my phone. Their mind numbing games I’ll play during a bit of down time. I’d been doing that for several months while recovering from my motorcycle accident. When the question popped into my mind, I knew the apps had to go. It may take a bit of time to catch this type of behavior. It may happen almost instantly. The great thing is catching the behavior. It’s more important for me to change behavior than the amount of time it takes to recognize the behavior. In years past, I had no recognition at all. With a mindset shift, I’ve got some recognition and it’s improving. Perhaps one day all the distractions will be instantaneously recognized, but today, incremental improvements are much welcomed.\nToday, Monday, May 13, 2024, I am grateful that:\nMy weekend was productive. I got a chance to get some audio recorded and a few other things. \nEven though deceased, I don’t have to wait for Mother’s Day to remember my Mom. I think of her nearly everyday and I’m happy I can remember without reliving. It’s healthy to think fondly of loved ones deceased, but reliving their deaths means I haven’t properly grieved the loss and there’s a bit more work to put in on that front. \nI’ll finish my audio recordings and course this week. I’ll send the first draft to a few trusted advisors and we’ll see what amendments are needed. I’ll make those and begin to make an impact by publishing my course.\nWhere is your focus?\nDo you focus on what you want?\nHave you realized you get more of what you focus on?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "Mini Milestone Celebration",
        "content": "Mini Milestone Celebration\nYesterday I was able to complete the first draft or iteration of a project for my mentor. I’d been working on it for over a month and faced a bunch of obstacles. It’s not ideal, nor is it the way I envisioned it, but it’s close. The technology is basically in the first generation and although I can see where it’s going and how it’ll improve, what I sent over to my mentor will have to suffice for now. \nLast week I’d written about iteration and making improvements later, but having something to put out now. I took my own advice and applied that very lesson. It’s not perfect, but it’s really good. At least I think so and I’m certain my mentor will think the same. Ideally the version I sent would be the version I envisioned, but we live in the real world and ideal is not always the case. With the first version completed, I celebrated.\nA low profile and rather basic celebration, but a celebration nonetheless. I ate lunch at one of my favorite places and I strolled around casually reveling in hitting a milestone. A bit later, I walked around my new building and actually did something I don’t usually do, I bought a fancy coffee. For health reasons, I drink black coffee every morning, no sugar, no cream. Since I was celebrating I chose to indulge with cream and sugar in the form of a latte. \nI’m aware eating lunch and drinking a latte isn’t much of a celebration. I’m also aware that staying close to home, not hitting the bar with friends and drinking away the night isn’t much of a celebration. However, basking in the moment and acknowledging the accomplishment is the celebration. It’s another step along the journey. Yesterday’s accomplishment inches me a bit closer to the end goal. It puts me just a little closer and that’s worth noting. \nOftentimes we may think the accomplishment is too small. Oftentimes, if it’s not the end goal, we’re dismissive. I’ve been that way in my past and I’m sure others have as well. I no longer desire, nor will I allow myself to diminish my accomplishments. Some may have enjoyed a night of revelry if they’d accomplished the same, but for me, I’m well aware there’s more that’s needed. I’m not at the end of my journey, but I’m a little bit closer.\nToday, Wednesday, July 17, 2024, I am grateful that:\nOne milestone was achieved. I’ll set another milestone of one per day until the end of the month. That’s my new task at hand.\nPrompting is becoming less challenging. It takes practice as with everything, and I’m happy to be more comfortable with something I hadn’t even heard of a year ago. \nThe thought of practicing and learning the piano came to mind. It may be something that’ll aid in my rehab. I’ll speak to a professional and get their expert feedback before continuing, but it may truly assist. The mere possibility brings hope.\nHow do you acknowledge completion of milestones?\nAbe, \nBe Greater!!!\nid\n501041064749-p8r11ful09bjdqvolg04lp7aask232lt.apps.googleusercontent.com\nSecret\n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"

More recently, I’d write on my vanity mirror and those items were lost to time when I erased them the following morning. Today I write, typically five days per week. Some days I miss a session. Most days I do not. \nIn my experience, the pursuit of perfect is admirable. However, mindfulness that the pursuit is the most important is vital. Its attainment may very well prove elusive. When I obsess, which isn’t often, over perfection, serenity doesn’t exist. When I remember the progress I’ve made, assurance and self confidence abound. The reason is simple. Being the best version of myself today is all I can strive to attain. I am unable to to do more than my best. \nMy mentor and spiritual advisor would often remind me to “Give ‘em your best big man. Give ‘em your best.” My best efforts today do not and will never be my best on another day. Perfection is similar. Attempting to live error free could and probably is considered a noble endeavor. However, when I miss the target, like yesterday, I must remind myself that even though I didn’t get it perfectly, I did better than I’d done in the past.\nToday, Friday, January 11, 2024, I am grateful that: \nDaniel and I got a chance to catch up. We hadn’t spoken in months so it was great dialogue. All’s well for us both. \nGot a chance to catch up with Moe. He’s been hosting relatives from America so we hadn’t spoken in a few weeks. Good to have friends near and far physically, but always near and dear to my heart.\nBlanco and I had a chance to talk. He needs some work done. He’s got a problem and asked if I could solve it. Told him of course and I’m grateful for the chance to be of service, plus earn some cash for my talents. \nAre you constantly striving for perfection?\nHow do you behave when and if you miss the mark?\nHow quickly do you forgive yourself?\nAbe, \nBe Greater"

        "content": "Missing Ingredients\nNot sure if you’ve ever been cooking, or preparing to cook a meal and noticed that something was missing. Whether it was a particular seasoning, which is usually true in my case, or something else, whatever it is doesn’t happen to be in the kitchen. You can look around, checking every cabinet a couple of times, only to realize your item really isn’t there. You’ve got two choices: go to the supermarket and get the thing you need or improvise and make your meal without that ingredient. \nI enjoy cooking, not cleaning, but the actual cooking is something I enjoy. I don’t follow recipes all the time. Most of the time, I improvise. With a meal that’s usually just for myself, I figure if I don’t like, I’ll eat it anyway and remember not to do that in the future. If it’s something I do like, I get a bit frustrated that I didn’t write down the recipe as I went along, knowing I’ll never recall the identical recipe again. Either way, it’s the way I’ve been doing things. \nI’m currently preparing a meal that’ll feed generations yet unborn. I’ve got most of the ingredients, but according to the recipe, a couple are missing. I’ve failed enough to know I can’t improvise this time. I've had enough success to know I may have been lucky, but don’t count on that in the future. This time I’ll follow the recipe. I don’t have the time, nor the inclination to improvise. People are counting on me and I can’t disappoint them or myself. \nSpontaneity is great and exciting. But there are some drawbacks. When things don’t work out like you’d hope they would, you’re left there looking stupid and in disbelief. “Measure twice, cut once” comes to mind. The greats, the masters of their craft can improvise at times, but I’m not a master of my craft. My experience is a mile wide and an inch deep. These masters I’m referring to have an inch wide and a mile of depth. They know a lot about a little, as compared to a little about a lot. These masters are subject matter experts. \nI’m working towards mastery and I have to follow the recipe. I have to assemble the proper ingredients. I have to confer with other masters. I must or I fail. I will be left improvising and quite possibly standing there in disbelief if things don’t work out. I have not the time or the energy to start over from a snafu, a foolish, childish, not very well planned endeavor. I have to follow the recipe. It’s been laid out by other masters of their craft. I simply have to assemble the ingredients and follow the recipe. Improvising may come later, but later isn’t today.\nToday, Tuesday, September 10, 2024, I am grateful that:\nNeural coupling exists. It’s a fancy way of describing what storytelling does for or with our brains. I’m guessing that’s what makes me like metaphors so much and what makes some of the best selling books of all times. I’m guessing, but I suspect it’s true.\nThe recipe is already laid out. Now I have to gather the ingredients and follow the directions. I’ve been reluctant to gather all the ingredients, the main one is money, but I know improvising is not an option. My task at hand is to overcome the fear I currently have by gathering the rest of the ingredients.\nAlthough reluctant and moving slowly towards gathering my ingredients, I am moving. It’s not something I take lightly. It’s something I do take seriously. I can taste the finished dish, but I’m still prepping in the kitchen. I’ve got a bit more work to get done and that starts with the ingredients.\nDo you have all your ingredients?\nIf not, which ingredients do you lack?\nHow will you acquire them?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "Missing The Mark",
        "content": "Missing The Mark\nIdeally, I write five days a week. My gratitude lists are a means to stave off depression and enhance my relationship with my Creator. We all miss the mark on occasion. I have missed my mark twice this week. Yesterday and the day before I missed my mark. It happens and I’ve come to accept the fact that I am not perfect. Ideal is defined as most suitable or satisfying one’s conception of what is perfect. \nTo put it another way - It would be perfect if I wrote my gratitude lists five days a week. That’s perfection in my mind, but reality often differs from what I conceive in my mind’s eye. This is probably true for others as well. Some may think of the ideal car, home, school for their kids, or position at work. Others may think of their ideal client or customer, their ideal amount of compensation or the ever elusive work life balance. Whatever your ideal version of something is I can guarantee that reality will likely be different. It often is and that’s okay. \nGetting closer than nothing is wonderful. Manifestation in perfect or ideal form takes practice and time. It’s not something that’ll occur perfectly the first or second time, in my experience. There are numerous times when I’ve envisioned something only to have it turn out quite differently that my vision. There are other times when it was perfect. Some say be careful what you wish for cause you just might get it. I say be specific in what you wish for cause it will happen. \nYears and years ago I wanted a job where I had flexibility with my schedule and I could travel, meet different people and make good money. After entering the insurance industry all of those things came true. I traveled to these small towns in Texas, met interesting people, and made what I thought was good money at the time. The position also came with getting up at 4 or 430 in the morning, driving for hours on end to reach my destination, and spending tons of time alone in the car. \nI also envisioned myself penning my book in Rio de Janeiro. The first month I was there wasn’t anything like my vision. After finding another place to live, my vision revealed itself the first morning in the new place. The view from my window was the same as I’d dreamt about for years prior. Had I been even more specific, I may have envisioned myself having conversation in Portuguese and not struggling to communicate, but again, manifestation takes practice.\nWe all have our ideal version of things. I’ve yet to meet and I’m doubtful that I will ever meet anyone that everything has always gone as perfectly as they’d like. I’m guessing somewhere, someone exists that that is the case, but I haven’t met them yet. What I know is perseverance and resilience are paramount. Being able to stick with the plan is vital. Being able to remain flexible is essential. Being able to adapt to changing circumstances and push forward even when you miss your mark is what’s paramount. Do not stop. Do not quit. Keep going, no matter what happens. Your ideal version of what’s to happen may be a little different than reality and that’s totally okay. \nToday, Friday, May 17, 2024, I am grateful that:\nMy first draft of my course is completed. It’s not ready for launch, but it will be before the end of the month. After putting everything together, recording the audio, and compiling some activity sheets for students, I learned or remembered some lessons I’d forgotten. The principle that you haven’t mastered a subject until you can teach it comes to mind. \nHerb and I had our weekly conversation. After completing my course, I’m sure I’ll have at least one of his books to complete. He’s got several, but we’ll start with one and build from there. The same will be true for Diana, except she doesn’t have the books. She’s got tons of subject matter expertise that’s needs to be documented. \nI’m beginning to see some of the fruits of my labor. I’m not in harvest season yet, but I can see the my crops are almost ready. It’s a great feeling to get to this stage. All of the pieces of the puzzle are nearly in place and I’m ready to place them in their proper places and admire the completed picture.\nHow do you deal with missing your mark?\nDo you criticize yourself?\nAre you understanding of what made you miss your mark?\nIf those things were out of your control, do you give yourself some grace?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "content": "Momentum\nOne definition is ‘the impetus gained by a moving object” and for me, I’ll say it builds upon itself. Newton’s First Law of Motion talks about it more, but from personal experience, I know with motion or momentum, one thing builds on another. The start is challenging, but each step, task, or goal met, generates more momentum. Life and business moves at a seemingly greater rate. Again, the start is challenging, and that’s where I am now.\nAFter two months off, rehabilitating from the traffic accident, it’s challenging, at this moment and this week. Work seems more tedious, my schedule seems off, and my reasons aren’t as strong or convincing as they once were. I’ve had another awakening, an epiphany if you will. Myron Golden says, “It’s easier to make a lot of money, in a short period of time than it is to make a little money over a long period of time.” I’d prefer and will be working towards the first, not the later. I’m on borrowed time and that’s how I will behave moving forward. \nMy current contract provides momentum. Another ongoing or completed task will do the same. Each task or step completed will get me going again. It’s challenging at the start and this is the beginning of another chapter. Life goes on, the music keeps playing, and this interlude will fade into something else. One thing, one task, one step completed consistently will offer momentum. It’s what I need and perhaps, it’s what you need as well.\nToday, Thursday, April 4, 2024, I am grateful that:\nThe importance of momentum and consistency have become evident. In years passed, I didn’t know those things. I thought I had bad luck or what not, but today I know different.\nI’ve been able to write and work everyday this week. It may not seem like much and a couple of months ago I would have thought the same. Having something forcibly ripped away makes me now appreciate it upon its return.\nMy right arm is improving. I can type almost painlessly today. I only use two, sometimes three fingers on the hand and typing is quite slow, relatively speaking, but it is progress. Progress helps create momentum when done consistently.\nHow can you create momentum today? \nIf you possess momentum, how can you increase it?\nAbe,\nBe Greater"

        "content": "Money Can’t Be The Only Thing\nIn my past and today, it seems as if money is the only thing slowing me down. My entire existence can not be defined by such an arbitrary thing. I know it’s needed for survival, for living, and more importantly for thriving. Yet, the relentless pursuit of such an object can not be the only thing. It has to be the by -product of fulfilling my purpose. It must come from placing a monetary amount less than the value of the solutions I offer to others. \nAdditionally, I can’t let a lack of money be the sole or primary reason I don’t move forward. That’s truly been a reality. I’ve always been creative, yet my inability to follow through, my inconsistencies, my sloth, and my lack of financial resources, yes money, are all part of my reasons for not being further along the path to financial freedom. The interesting thing is varied exposure to industries and individuals who’ve taught me what’s needed. I hear and learn the lessons, but for one of the many reasons I mentioned earlier, I didn’t apply the lesson.\nMaybe the most important reason for not being further along is something I didn’t mention. Money was never important to me. I’ve had limited success in practically every endeavor I’ve undertaken. A couple things would always happen when it was time to elevate to the next layer. One was my sloth would kick in. Another was I didn’t have anybody to share it with. Lastly, the false illusion that I could always do it later. None of those are true today. I’ve learned different. My experience tells me to become the ideal version of me and my ideal woman will appear. Sloth is basically nonexistent since discovering my purpose. Today is all we have. There’s no guarantee for the next day. My motorcycle accident made that crystal clear. \nAs I sit here writing this out, something just popped into my mind. If money is the only thing and as a result of acquiring the money, I get to do what I was created to do, then and only then, money can be the only thing. Not sure how that sits with me since I’m too busy writing to really process those words, it’ll marinate and manifest something more in depth at some point.\nToday, Tuesday, April 9, 2024, I am grateful that:\nPhysically I’m getting better. It’s the one thing constantly on my mind. More than anything else, I want to be normal or as close to my normal as before.\nI was able to converse with a few friends yesterday. It’s great to have some that’ll call and check on you. Those friends that’ll make sure you’re ok, rain or shine, are the ones worth investing time and energy into.\nThe project for posting my gratitude list is coming along nicely. I should be able to get everything completed and launched before month’s end. I surely hope others receive the same or similar benefits that I’ve gotten from these lists.\nAre you obsessed with one thing? Money, a relationship, a career\nHow does that affect the rest of your life?\nDo you think you’re better for focusing on that one particular thing?\nHow will you success in that area benefit others, today and in the future?\nWould they benefit more if you were readily available today?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "content": "Money, Mastery, Mentors, and Missions\nIn keeping with a theme taught by Mr. and Mrs. Logan before I became a teenager, if you don’t know what a word means, use the dictionary. I’ve since learned that some of the words I thought knew what they meant, the dictionary had a different definition. Let's lay a foundation before we build. Money is currently a medium of exchange. Mastery is comprehensive knowledge or skill in a subject or accomplishment. A second definition would be control or superiority over someone or something. Mentor is an experienced or trusted adviser. Missions are a strongly felt aim, ambition, or calling. \nIf you or someone you loved needed immediate medical attention, after calling emergency services, an ambulance would arrive at your place. The paramedics would do an assessment, then transport you to the nearest hospital. Next, an emergency room physician would assess once more and begin treatment. The paramedic and the doctor both have a mission, to render medical aid. But the doctor possesses comprehensive knowledge or skill as compared to the paramedic. During their internship and residency, the doctor was partnered with a more experienced person, a doctor who already completed their training. Someone who demonstrated superiority over something, the treatment of patients in emergency situations. \nBoth paramedics and doctors are in the medical field, yet oe possess mastery while the other does not. The average annual salary for one is about $50,000 per year, the other is more than seven times that amount, a little more than $370,000 per year. I’ve heard it said that ‘money follows mastery’ and if you needed proof, there’s one example. \nI’m currently on a mission, to fulfill my purpose. Part of which requires me to master a few more skills. I will. If you leave your house without knowing where you’re going, chances are you will wander around aimlessly for minutes, hours or longer. You also need to know why you’re leaving home to begin with. If you know where you’re going and why you need to, little things like road construction, detours, and delays will not deter you from your destination. Those small inconveniences may slow you down, but they won't stop you. A good friend of mine says, “The what and the why are free…” and there you have it. \nToday, Friday, April 25, 2024, I am grateful that:\nClarity is returning. I’m not normal yet, but things aren’t as fuzzy this morning. Speaking and writing with metaphors is something I do well. Being unable to do so before is a great indicator of how cloudy my thoughts were.\nI discovered my mission or purpose years ago. The past six or seven years compared to the previous few decades is something I wouldn’t trade the experience of. Living and learning with a specific mission in mind has gotten me further along my journey than most other things combined. \nAlbeit small, I did receive a direct deposit today. It’s the last few hours on a freelancer contract, but every peso counts at this stage. I won’t complain about my lack of financial resources, but I will never allow myself to return to this place financially.\nWhat’s your mission?\nWhich skills are required to accomplish it?\nWhich of those skills have you mastered?\nWhat can you do today to move a bit closer to mastery in the areas that are lacking?\nAbe, \nBe Greater!!!\nConfidence Career  Interview Motivation Communication (Listening, Public Speaking, Presenting) Strengths / Weaknesses Self Understanding Leadership Optimism / Positivity / Happiness Organization / Efficiency Families / Parenting / Relationships Purpose / Passion / Vision Assertiveness / Attitude "

        "title": "Month One, Almost Done",
        "content": "Month One, Almost Done\nEvery year people make New Year’s Resolutions. The majority, as much as eighty percent(80%) according to a recent Time magazine article, abandon their resolutions before February. With another month fast approaching, how are you doing towards your resolutions? Did you really resolve to accomplish those things? Do you know the origins of the word? Let’s take a look, it may help.\nAs a noun, resolution is about breaking things down into simple terms or smaller parts. As an adjective, back in the 1500s it was used to describe someone “determined or having a fixed mind.” That’s for resolve and New Years resolution popped up in the late 1780s. We can use both definitions, the noun and the adjective, but I’d rather get to something that may prove more beneficial, a practical solution I have and continue to employ. \nTomorrow isn’t promised. I haven’t done the research, but I’m willing to bet more people die from January 2 through December 30 than New Year’s Eve and New Year’s day. My point is simple: What’s stopping you from resolving today? Why on Earth would you wait? We don’t know if we will see another day, let alone another year. Make the most of this day, this moment in time, as it’ll never come again. \nI understand the folly of going with the crowd. Everyone likes to discuss the changes they’ll make in the upcoming year. As humans we like to go with our tribe. It’s most uncomfortable when we don’t. I’ve learned that being uncomfortable is not a bad thing. In fact, until I began changing who I associated with, it was quite uncomfortable. But, the new circle of friends live in a constant state of discomfort. They offer encouraging words to those traversing similar pain. Because they, unlike the majority, understand the challenges. \nWasting time waiting for a particular day to be determined is, in my experience, folly. If you really want and desire change, make a change. Be silent in your approach. Maybe find one or two supportive, like minded individuals and share that change with them. Another tip or trick which worked well is speaking of something I changed in the past tense. When I’d quit smoking if someone asked if I wanted to smoke, like when we were at dinner, I’d respond kind of surprised and say, “I don’t do that anymore” or “I don’t smoke.” Between my confused expression and the tone of my voice, they quickly accepted that I was a non-smoker, even if we’d smoked a cigarette together in the last week. Speaking of my “resolutions” as things I used to do worked incredibly well. It put my mind and my friends and family on notice that that particular behavior or habit was no longer part of who I was I currently was doing. \nI’ve made some changes, immense to others, which are just part of my journey. I’ve remained resolute in the majority of the changes for well over five years. A few have lasted a bit longer and a couple have lasted for decades. As you make your changes and walk into this newest version of yourself, as time passes, you’ll begin to realize, as have I, that the past thing is so far removed from who you currently are, it’ll be challenging to recall how you felt while doing it all that time ago. \nToday, Friday, January 26, 2024, I am grateful that:\nHerb and I spoke yesterday. Week in and week out, he’s about the only one I speak on a consistent basis. You are who you hang with comes to mind. As our friendship has grown, so has my consistency. Herb is one of the most consistent or disciplined people I know.\nI made some progress on the hosting account. It’s not perfect, but I did get the domain forwarded and Wordpress installed. Depending on how long I work today, I may get the questions I have about the domain answered and be able to start building out the site.\nAll three of the kittens under my care are here and healthy. Nearly six months ago, two of the kittens’ mother was hit by a car. About two, maybe three months ago, another one was abandoned. Maybe only a few days old at that point, very sickly and weak. All three are healthy, eating more food than I care to buy, and playing with each other during the day. That does me good to play a small part. \nIf you’re having challenges keeping your resolve, check out other posts, comment, and participate in a community of like minded individuals.\nAbe, \nBe Greater!!!"

        "content": "More and More Momentum\n“Inch by inch it’s a cinch” comes to mind this morning. Most of us, myself included, like to make leaps and bounds for progress. I know it’s something I plan for and look forward to, but life has a way of happening. When things don’t work out like planned, when progress isn’t as fast as I'd like, when systems and processes don’t work like I thought they would when implementing them, that’s when I remember that some progress is better than no progress at all.\nLife has a tendency to shrink my ego. I have resolve. I have conviction. I have focus, determination, and I am resilient. Life does what it does - it keeps going. My ability to see how I want it and how it will be when it’s finished is not an exact science. It’s a work in progress, meaning it’ll change and I have to recognize when it’s time to adapt. \nEarlier this week I landed a contract. Last night during the interview, I saw an opportunity to render a service for the company. I suggested it, they agreed and boom, a one off project that’ll pay more than the hourly contract I was interviewing for. The other gig may come to fruition too, but a short term project, one off project for a couple of hours of work is good as well. My second interview was rescheduled for today and that’s fine too. The thing is putting myself, my expertise and availability out into the marketplace. I hadn’t done that with consistency and I haven’t had much momentum. I’m doing it now more than before and it seems to build upon itself.\nTake a small step, an inch closer to your destination and enjoy. You’re a bit closer than you were before that step. The next step will come with less effort. As you and I keep inching forward every bit of progress builds momentum. An inch turns to a foot then a yard and so on. But if we think we’ll make progress miles at a time, you might find yourself disappointed, as have I. Today small progress, a little momentum is not only acceptable, it’s welcome.\nToday, Friday, August 2, 2024, I am grateful that:\nInches and opportunities for more inches are arriving. I’ve been out of the market and out of work for six months. Now that I’m able to perform competently, and have made myself available, opportunities are revealing themselves.\nI’m feeling more confident in my ability to solve problems. For months my cognitive abilities were diminished. I could not function as I have in the past and although willing, I wasn’t able. I’m feeling more like me and that’s a good thing.\nHerb and I had our weekly conversation. I’ve made some progress on his project and I’ll have another draft completed before next week. It’s great to have someone willing to venture into new endeavors, all the while sharing their experience. \nDo you acknowledge small victories?\nAre you willing to travel an “inch” versus waiting for the miles?\nCan you see your small steps getting you closer to your destination?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "content": "More Cooking\nYesterday I wrote about following recipes and having all the ingredients. I expressed the need to have a recipe and just as important, to have all the ingredients before beginning. I also talked about my experience with improvising and although exciting in the moment, I failed to either duplicate a great recipe or created some dish I never wanted to taste again. After acquiring your recipe and all its ingredients, it’s almost time to start cooking.\nFor as long as I can remember, my Mom handled things in the kitchen. From cooking to cleaning, she ruled her domain. One of the things she would often say about cooking is “Clean as you go.” I mentioned yesterday how I enjoy cooking, but not cleaning. Seems to take the joy out of something I really enjoy. But that’s a lesson for another day, today we’ll discuss the meal itself. \nHaving a recipe and all the ingredients doesn’t mean we get to start eating right away. Heck, we don’t even get to start cutting until we’ve done a bit of prep work. Prep meaning preparation or preparing meaning it’s now time to clean our cooking area, measure our ingredients according to the recipe, and make sure everything is ready to go and in place for the masterpiece we’re about to prepare. \nIf, for example, we’re preparing a chocolate cake, we’d need flour, butter, chocolate, amongst other things. We’d also need a mixing pan, a spatula at a minimum, something to grease our cooking pan so the cake doesn’t stick, and we’d need to preheat our oven. Having a recipe, a formula, doesn’t insure our success. There’s still work that has to be completed before we actually begin. \nOnce we’ve measured and mixed our flour, butter, chocolate, and other ingredients, we’ll transfer them from our mixing bowl and into our cooking pan. Afterwards we’ll place that in our preheated oven and finally set the timer. Notice, we’ve put in a bunch of work and we still haven’t eaten. What’s worse for me and maybe not for you, is waiting. Now that we’ve put in all the work, it’s in the oven, our cake isn’t ready to eat. We still have to wait. \nIf our recipe says cook at a certain degree for 30 minutes and we remove the cake at 20 minutes, we’ll know the cake isn’t ready. If we let the cake cook for 40 or 45 minutes, we didn’t follow our recipe, it’s dried out, not as moist, and not even close to what we’d anticipated. But, if we remove it 30 minutes, we still can’t dig in and take a hearty slice. We must let the cake rest. We must let the cake settle and cool down a bit before we enjoy the fruits of our labor. The same is true with life.\nIf our meal is to retire as a multimillionaire at age 65, there are some ingredients we need to fill this recipe. First we’ll need a career, white collar, blue collar, it doesn’t matter. We’ll need some sort of valuable skill we can exchange for money. In this instance let’s say we’re a mechanic. We start by going to a trade school that teaches us the ins and out of our industry. We acquire the tools, metaphorical and literal, place them in our toolbox and get to work cooking. \nNext, we’ll need a way to set aside our excess money. The excess we have needs to grow over the time we’ll work in our careers, that’s basically our cooking time in the oven. Our recipe shows us that we can save or set aside more than what’s called for, but if we save 15% of our $30,000 per year salary until we’re 65, with an average of 8% returns every year, we’ll retire with well over a million dollars in our retirement account. \nThe math aside cause it maybe confusing, it’s our recipe. Set aside at least 15% of our income and let it cook until we take it out of the oven. We can save more, according to the recipe, we could change all the numbers, but the thing to remember is we have a recipe. We knew what we were doing, cooking a retirement dinner, before we began. We gathered our ingredients by educating ourselves with a skill we could exchange for money. We generated an excess of money and put into our mixing bowl with an interest rate that pays us money on what we put in. We put our mixture into the oven and set the timer. Now we wait for it to finish cooking. No more, no less, heck we don’t even have to keep checking on our cake. We just let it cook.\nWe can have a recipe. We can have all the ingredients. We still have to assemble. We still have to cook. We have to put in work, before the reward. It’s the way of life.\nToday, Wednesday, September 11, 2024, I am grateful that:"

        "title": "More Discipline",
        "content": "More Discipline\nSocrates said, “The unexamined life is not worth living.” I tend to agree. When thinking of self discipline it’s easier to go into a negative mindset and think of how little discipline I possess. It’s more challenging to take a step back, think of what I’ve accomplished, and the improvements I’ve made. \nI’ve written about some of the benefits of exercising more discipline, but there’s another side of the coin. Some of the consequences I’ve faced are things I don’t want to experience again.  My failures outnumber ny successes in many areas. You can say I have resilience. I say I have a mission. I am living to fulfill my purpose. That’s my mentality today, but before I discovered the reason I was created, I behaved differently.\nI bounced from job to job, career to career with no thought, no vision, no plan whatsoever. If confronted and asked, I would say “I just want to be happy.” At th time my thoughts were probably along the lines of pursuing happiness. After assessing my career choices I discovered it wasn’t about finding happiness, but truly about learning new things. I was happiest when learning new things. I didn’t strive to be the absolute best at whatever I did. I wanted to possess a working knowledge and competence, but mastery was something I never strived for. In part because in my min, mastery meant I would be pigeon holed into one particular thing. Freedom, in part, means being able to do whatever I want, for as long as I want, with whomever I want. I couldn’t possibly do those things if I had to be at the office or a car dealership or some other job. \nAll of the careers, all the positions I’ve held, all of the tests and certifications I passed and possessed are the consequences from lack of discipline. My inability to adhere to a code of behavior led to those things. After discovering, defining, and working towards fulfilling my purpose, I’ve had one career. I write. I may write a novel, a sales letter, video sales letter, an email series, or white paper, but I write. I’ve studied and still study from some of the best writers in history. I practice and work on perfecting or mastering my craft. \nDiscipline has its benefits. Discipline also has its consequences. Today, I know my choices and decisions determine which of those things I experience. Experience may indeed be the best teacher. It’s been my experience that my life is exponentially better when I adhere to a code of behavior - when I am disciplined. \nToday, Tuesday, April 30, 2024, I am grateful that:\nOur power was restored. It’s summer and this is by far the hottest summer I’ve experienced since living here. It didn’t take long to begin feeling the heat and this was almost as bad as post Typhoon Odette.\nA couple more items of creativity are coming to mind. The ideas are a sign that I’m recovering. Not racing thoughts, but rather, new thoughts and ways to connect processes and practices from several industries into another industry.\nAlthough disrupted this morning, I was able to continue my writing. I know now, not like before, that others will read these and some may come to depend on them. Now it’s becoming more about not letting others down or disappointing them. Of course it’s also about discipline and communing with my Creator, but the added benefit of helping others is the cherry on top of an excellent sundae.\nWhat are three consequences you’ve experienced from a lack of discipline?\nHow can you avoid repeating the same pattern?\nWhat tips, tricks, of techniques do you employ now to reap the benefits and not the consequences?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "content": "More Is Required\nIf you’re putting in some effort but still haven’t reached where you want to go, more is required. There may be several reasons, but the long and short of it is, more is required. One reason could be timing. You reap what you sow, but not when you sow. Farmers don’t plant seeds in April and harvest in April. It doesn’t work that way in nature.\nAnother reason could be the effort you’re putting in may not be enough. You may be working and putting the time, but you may have unproductive time. If you’re putting in 12 or 16 hour days and still can’t get the results you’re wanting, you may need to look at what you’re doing those hours of work. Years ago I was telling a friend of mine how busy I was and that I wasn’t able to get as much done as I’d like. Her response was, “You’re busy, but are you productive?” I gave me reason to pause and since her most profound of questions, I not only look at the amount of time I work, but also the activities done in that time.\nThose are two of the things i’ve experienced which come to mind this morning. I’m certain there are more and I may discuss at a later time. More is required as the title has one more meaning. Do not quit. Do not yield. Do not stop. If you aren’t getting what you want, don’t stop working towards completing your mission. \nIf you aren’t willing to delay some gratification, think about your reasons for doing what you’re doing. It will be challenging and uncomfortable. It will take longer than you thought or planned. It will require more and that’s the whole point. The more challenging, the more time consuming the process, the more steps required, the more energy and effort that’s required, the more likely others will quit. They won’t persevere like you. The will yield and quit and the rewards you receive as compensation even greater. \nToday, Friday, June 13, 2024, I am grateful that:\nHerb and I spoke yesterday. He’s in great spirits. He is recovering from his medical episode the week prior and his spirit sounds strong. We covered a few things like normal and he provided some feedback on a program I’m putting together for him. \nAfter receiving some feedback, I’ll be able to complete the first draft for Herb in another day or so. I’ll also submit a proposal for my compensation. In years past, I’ve had challenges pricing my services, but I’ve found a solution I believe will be viable. Time will tell if I’m correct. \nAaron and I got a chance to catch up via Whatsapp. These days we both have projects going and it’s a challenge to have conversations, but we did get a chance to communicate and that’s important. Married life is treating him well.\nWhen’s the last time you checked your progress?\nAre you further along today than you were six months ago?\nHow much further do you need to go?\nAre you willing to put in the extra effort that’s required?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "Moving Ain’t Fun",
        "content": "Moving Ain’t Fun\nWithout giving too much energy to negative things, I’ll say over the weekend I moved to a new place. About a week or so ago, and it’s been brewing for longer than that, my landlord must have thought I couldn’t count to five. He kept insisting I owed him a couple months of back rent even when I produced the receipts he’d written. It’s Southeast Asia and none of them like to loose face, so after producing the receipts proving I owed nothing, I found another place to live back in the city. \nWhen I first arrived in Cebu I lived in this neighborhood. My new place is a bit closer than my first and it’s new. I’m the first person to occupy my unit. It’s smaller than most of the places I’ve lived, but the community here is a bit more upscale. It’s a nice change of echelon. A couple weeks ago I’d written about my inability to set and maintain a standard. I’d written about how I’d typically go with the flow, tell myself I’m outside of America and things will be uncomfortable. Today, the most uncomfortable part of the journey is unpacking and getting organized. \nInteresting thing about the entire situation is I never asked to live here. One of my friends owns and manages several condos throughout the city. When we were talking about my situation with the landlord, plus he knew of my desire to move back to the city and be closer to doctors and hospitals to continue my rehab, he offered this place. It’s a sweetheart deal. It’s a premium unit and out of my budget at the moment. Six months from now maybe not, but today, I couldn’t afford this place without his assistance. \nMove in, cover your utilities, and you can stay for a couple of months until I’m ready to get it decorated. He’s currently building out four or five other units in the same building so this one was sitting empty. I own all my furniture and needed an unfurnished place. Most are setup for tourist, which I’m not, so to find unfurnished in a new building in this location with the setup I currently have is my Creator making himself apparent once more.\nThroughout life, if I stop and assess different experiences, it’s clear how He has taken of and put things in place to make my path less challenging. Most of us are too busy trying to make a living that we don’t enjoy life. One of the benefits of writing consistently is these quiet mornings and the ability to reflect on what’s happening and how. I get to show others what happens while living with purpose. I get to show others how our Creator works, even with a small sample size like another place to live. Others can see me in motion and maybe, just maybe think to themselves that if he can do it, so can I. \nMoving ain’t fun, it ain’t pleasant, and it’s not something I typically enjoy. This move however has been simple and straightforward. I never even spoke with a realtor or searched for a property. I didn’t put down a deposit for the unit or any utilities. I said what was needed and my Creator made that possible. For years several of my friends have said, “God will either bless it or block it.” That’s the case here. He blessed it and I’m telling you about it cause I ain’t so special. If He will do it for me, He certainly will do it for you too.\nToday, Monday, July 1, 2024, I am grateful that:\nThe new place feels more like home. It’s smaller and I’ll need to purge some belongings, but the location is ideal. There are a few more locations that are near and when the end of my arrangements nears completion I’ll check some of them out. But being back in the city feels more like home than living in the rural areas.\nI’ll be able to get more work done today. I’ll be starting a few subscription services since I’ve finally got the cash to get those started and that’ll be the beginning. I’ll still have to do the heavy lifting with work, but I’m positive the technology already exist that’ll enable me to automate the entire process before the end of the year.\nI’ve met a few cool people already. One of them, Gune has a son attending culinary school. I was able to give his son some of the dinosaur egg salt I’d gotten and he was stunned. The live in the on country and had only heard about it. They’d never seen it or owned it. It felt good to pass along something so rare and precious to a chef in training.\nMoe was able to stop by a couple of days ago. He came through, made sure I was in the place, then helped a bit. Nothing too big, but all things I’m unable to do with limited use of my right hand. It’s really good having friends.\nCan you see how your Creator makes things possible in your life?\nHow often do you take time to reflect on those occurrences?\nAre there any ways you’d like to improve in that area?\nAbe, \nBe Greater!!!"

        "content": "No Plan, No Action, No Change\nWithout a plan, without action, we are without change. We remain the same. It’s interesting that we all death is certain. It’s certain that we know we have to work, with very few exceptions. We, you and me, have a finite amount of time on the planet. Most live as if it won’t end, but in the back of our minds, we all know it will. Maybe there’s some peculiar twist allowing us as humans to think if we don’t think or talk about it, it won’t happen. \nImagine needing to grab some milk or bread from the grocery store. If you have a car, you get your keys, and head out the door. Before getting in your car, you knew where you were heading. Before getting your keys, you knew your destination. Here’s a question: Do you know where you’re heading? With your family, with your career, with your education, your relationships, your love life, your marriage, your purpose, your legacy? Do you know where you’re heading?\nWe can all pretend like it won’t happen? We can think delusionally about our future. I sure did and for longer than I’d like to admit. But the sad reality of getting older is those things from five, ten, twenty years ago don’t seem so long ago. It seems not that long ago that I was living in America, but I’ve been in the Philippines for over five years. I have the fondest of memories thinking about Rio de Janeiro, but that was over seven years ago. I recall with fondness graduating high school, but that was more thirty years ago. \nThe truth of the matter is life goes on. Time wait for no man. It’s as simple as that. We can all pretend as if we know where we’re going or we can have a plan, just like going to the grocery store. We can plan out the trip to the store. We can plan out steps to get inside the store, grab our items, and head to the cashier. We can even see ourselves walking back to the car and driving back home. But how is it we can’t see ourselves living with purpose? How is it we can’t envision ourselves living debt free? How is it we can go through life doing the most mundane of tasks, but those that are truly vital, we can’t envision? The is rather straightforward - we never sat down and mapped out future.\nAs I continue to write these lists, I’ll put some of the things I’ve done. What’s worked and what hasn’t. The benefits I received and the lessons I’ve learned. Shannon Sharpe said, “A fool learns from his experience. A wise man learns from the experience of others.” In the same vein, I’ll, “Be weary of those offering their opinions and grateful for those sharing their experience.”\nToday, Monday, January 22, 2024, I am grateful that: \nI was able to secure my hosting plan for my websites. I’ve got several sites to build out and without a hosting plan none get built or seen.\nI’m generating a bit of momentum. Not much, but some. Slow progress is progress. I’m my own worse critic at times, but not today.\nThe weekend was nice and relaxing. Got a chance to recharge the battery, tweak my plans, and get a bit of cleaning done. Nothing major, other than a wrap up party for Sinulog. Not as good as last year, but still a nice turn out and always a nice venue.\nHerb and I spoke on Friday, instead of Thursday. The lessons and accountability are invaluable. I haven’t tried to put a dollar value on his experience, but I’m certain it’s currently beyond what I can pay.\nWhat’s your destination?\nWhat’s your plan to get there?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "content": "Nothing Is Wasted…\nA few moments ago, I was on social media and a friend of mine and former neighbor posted, “No need to cut people off, just grow - they’ll fall off!” I thought for a second then commented, “Just like leaves, what remains of them will become fertilizer for your continued growth. Nothing is wasted in His world!!!” Think about how many people you were once extremely close to, but for whatever reason that’s no longer true. Now, if you can recall how the relationship soured, if it soured, think about how you behave differently because of that incident. \nThe relationship is over, but the residual benefits remain. It may have been some form of betrayal, deceit, or similar, but whatever happened between you and them forced you to make lasting changes. From that point to now and moving forward, you have chosen to not allow that type of behavior. It is no longer, and maybe wasn’t at the time it happened, acceptable. If asked by an objective third party if you “allow” or “accept” then fill in the blank with whatever ended the relationship, I’m guessing you’d respond with a firm “No.” Or maybe you’d elaborate and say, “At one time that was acceptable, but I believe differently today.” You may even explain your reasoning for believing the way you do. After something is eliminated from ourselves, we’ve closed off that aspect entirely and speak of it in the past tense.\nI used to drink alcohol. When asked today if I drink, I respond with a polite, but firm “No. ” If pressed, I’ll offer an explanation, but the truth is, that’s not something I do anymore. The trick for me today, and what I’ve been working on is abundance. Not having plenty is no longer acceptable. Barely getting by or sometimes needing help is something I can no longer allow. Working to “break even” is something I must eliminate. \nWe all those areas and aspects of our lives. Today, at this moment, mine is monetary. Second to that is physical. You may have read me talking about the benefits of experience. You know the old adage of “Experience is the best teacher.” Now I’m tasked with going through my existing relationships, finding out which of my many friends has eliminated poverty, replaced it with abundance, and kindly ask them a bunch of questions. From where I sit, I’ve done what I know how to do. From lower expenses, avoiding frivolous spending, and the like. It’s not enough, something is missing and that’s the experience I need to discover. That’s what I need to learn. I’m certain once abundance resides within me, I’ll no longer accept scarcity.\nToday, Wednesday, January 31, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI was able to help a client meet a deadline. I’m exhausted and didn’t protect what was sacred yesterday, but flexibility is key. An exception doesn’t make the rule. Perfection is elusive. I can strive for such, but its achievement may always evade me and my best laid plans.\nThe fallen leaves of scarcity will become fertilizer for my abundance. That lesson is resonating so well at the moment. I only do social media for a few moments each day. Today, unlike most days, it proved valuable.\nDiana will arrive tomorrow. It’ll be good to see each other. We haven’t hung out since Hurricane Harvey in 2017. We’ve spoken, but to actually “break bread” and fellowship will be great. Plus, it’ll be cool to show her my resident country, or parts thereof, for the past five years. \nDo what’s written above. The past relationships, the current benefits, and your gratitude for them.\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "Of Course I Know Why",
        "content": "Of Course I Know Why\nBefore going too much further down this new path, let’s review. I’ve written about discovering your purpose or the reason you were created. I’ve also written about being intentional or moving and acting with purpose. I’ve written about much more than that and not sure entirely of where you may have run across these posts, but that’s the starting point. I’ve also written about how to keep moving forward when things get tough. Today, I’ll write a bit about what’s the reason for doing what you’re doing. \nTons of us talk about having a reason, but they’re usually flimsy. It may happen that you need to pay your rent or mortgage. It could be the need for recognition in your career. It may also be an opportunity you didn’t want to miss. You may have countless reasons for taking the path you took. Here’s what I know for certain: your reason needs to be strong. \nFor me, I believe in my Creator. I believe there’s something bigger than us that governs all. I won’t go too far down that path, but I believe my Creator gave me a set of gifts or talents or better yet blessings. There are things I do better than most. There are things that I have consistently taken for granted for decades or for as long as I can recall. There are things which require little to no effort on my part. These things are almost second nature and I wield them with mastery. I know what they are and I’m willing to use them.\nYears ago I sat and assessed myself, my gifts, my abilities, and my current situation. I determined what I liked, what I didn’t like, and put it on paper. I kept reviewing those things for several days, maybe weeks. I then began to ask “how can I use these gifts?” I also asked, “What will you not do?” or “How will you not use your gifts?” I also asked myself, “What’s your reason for doing it in the first place?” It’s great to have gifts. It’s great to have talent, but the mastery and application of talent requires effort. When I don’t know the reason for doing something I tend to be lazy, without direction, and rather slothful. \nI recalled some reading I’d done. Napoleon Hill wrote about nine basic motives. I went through that list thinking of myself, my talents, and what I desired. Those became my reasons for doing what I am currently doing. Those things laid a foundation to build upon. Those motives ring true today, and for the last six or seven years, and probably rang true when the author wrote them. \nI just changed the name of the post from “Of course it’s possible” to “Of Course I Know Why” since I ventured a bit further down this road than intended. Friends ask what’s got me doing what I’m doing. Friends ask my reason for continuing down this particular path. Friends and family alike may be curious about my choices and that’s fine. I’m no longer curious. I know. When you know, you know.\nSome people get this lesson early in life. Others like myself, it takes a bit longer. The reason for doing what I’m doing and moving forward when others can’t see what I see is simple. It’s the reason I exist. \nNot much more can be said about that. I have distilled it down to its barest of essence. I do what I do because it’s what I was created to do. When it’s tough, when it’s seemingly impossible, when it’s easier to quit than to keep going, I keep going. Of course I know why I’m doing what I’m doing. Of course I know why I won’t quit. Of course I know it’s possible. Of course I know, of course!\nDo you?\nToday, Tuesday, August 27, 2024, I am grateful that: \nI found a site to help with content generation. Not my original content, but rather repurposing content for social media. I’m not good at changing the size of videos and what not, but I’ve tried it and it works. Happy about that. \nI’ve got what I need today. Some days are leaner than others. Money, or lack thereof, is an issue today. It’s not from a poverty mindset, but rather a shift in mentality. I’ve made a few decisions since my accident and I have less options to generate an income during this phase. It’ll change in about a month, but it’s lean at the moment. \nThe summaries and videos I’m putting together are helping me and possibly others. My original intent was for others, but I’m gaining some benefits of listening to books I’d read years ago. It’s great to have refresher courses, especially in areas I consider vital.\nDo you know why you do what you do?\nHow did you figure that out?\nIf you haven’t figured it out, how will you?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

What if the door that closes is meant to keep you out? What if you turn around and go back to reopen the closed door?\nThe thing about some of the sayings and quotes we’ve taken as truth is they are often half truths or perhaps not the best and most in a particular circumstance. Not to go too far down the rabbit hole, but there’s a possibility too that these sayings are meant to confuse and dissuade us as well. \nThe other thing about doors closing is it may very well be the shutting of one venture with hopes of another coming forth. I’m moving tomorrow. It’ll be another place, back in the city, and away from the rural areas of Cebu. It’s cool to live in another country and one of my best life experiences so far. The thing is though, a buddy of mine reminded me last night. He told me it’ll probably be good for me to get back around my tribe. \nMany more locals in my current place. A bunch have little to no interactions with foreigners. Most don’t know any foreigners and are self conscious about their English. My ability to speak the local language is limited and that’s being kind. So it’ll be great to be in the city once more. Living around a mix of foreigners, locals that are used to foreigners, and also foreign amenities. \nIt’s been years since I’ve lived according to the standards I’ve grown accustomed. Initially I told myself it was about being uncomfortable. Then I told myself I needed to get comfortable being uncomfortable. Then the accident happened and I changed. Comfort and discomfort are one thing, but setting and living by a certain standard is an entirely different story.\nI’d grown accustomed to not having or setting a standard. I went with the flow. I was okay with doing certain things and living in certain areas because I was under the guise of it’s all uncomfortable. Today, I’m like nope, that’s no longer acceptable. I must decide on my standards. Personally and professionally, once the decision has been made, I will only ascend and raise my strata. I hadn’t done that before, but while I was laying out the foundation for my company last week, I made a decision.\nOur company will offer one level of service offering. It will be all inclusive and the best that’s available at that particular moment in the industry. We will not offer a scaled down version of our service. Our service will provide what our ideal clients nee and want and we will not compromise our standards. If I’m willing to be unyielding in my company’s standards of excellence, why on Earth would I not abide by that personally?\nYou may or may not be able to relate to this, but it’s quite simple. I may have realized this years or decades ago, but it didn’t register until last week. Set my standards, work to maintain those, and work to another echelon until I’m at the pinnacle.\nToday, Thursday, June 27, 2024, I am grateful that:\nThe movers are scheduled for 9 a.m. in the morning. I’ll close this door and walk into another one. Not entirely sure how long I’ll stay in the new place and that’s the conditions of the move, but it’ll be a return to the city and that’s what’s most important.\nAfter a conversation with Gary, all my immediate concerns about finances are delayed. My new card arrived and it’s now activated. I’ll be able to take care of a few things and keep some momentum going.\nI got to take care of an immediate need for Dale. He’s been stressing about a situation and I was able to help. I don’t agree with his actions, but he asked for help, not my opinion or experience. I gave him what he asked for and was happy to do so. \nHave set clear standards for yourself? For profession? Your relationships? Your finances?\nDo you maintain those standards? If not, are you working relentlessly to do so?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

Time will tell.\nEarlier this week I read about the etymology of discipline. One of the definitions resonated and I’ve contemplated about it for a few days. It’s about following instructions or study or knowledge. With that being the case, I’m believing it’s time to follow the instructions and acquire the knowledge of those who’ve traversed the path I’m currently walking. Knowledge abounds, but applied knowledge is rare. \nI’ve got to find and apply the instructions from others. If not on an identical path, a path that’s quite similar. That’s a task worthy of completing this weekend. I’ll do that.\nToday, Friday, January 5, 2024, I am grateful that: \nI’ll be finding a source of tutelage. Not entirely sure of the person, but it’ll be interesting to embark on this part of my journey. \nI’m willing to be teachable. I’m not entirely willing to abandon what I know, but I am entirely willing to learn from others. Mentors, in person or via readings, save time and make me money, as I’ve written before. \n Abe Newmeyer is feeling more familiar. An alter ego is something I haven’t used since my childhood and it appears as if it’s time to embrace one again. \nWho’s tutelage can you follow?\nAbe,\nBe Greater"

        "content": "Plan To Paper\nToday is about putting my plan on paper. There are tons of other resources I could use, but being a bit old fashioned has its benefits. Pen to paper is the way for me to go today. I’ve got it pretty much laid out mentally. My edges are set. Now filling in the rest of the puzzle is vital. \nI spoke a bit earlier today to Victoria. We’re in similar places as far as planning is concerned. She’s launching her restaurant while running her other endeavors. We both spoke of our plans and the sequence. We offered each other input for improvements and shared both what’s worked well and not so well in previous experiences.\nPart of the collaborative process requires the sharing of experiences. Good and bad, right or wrong, our experiences inform our current and future decisions. “Experience is the best teacher” and I’ve started adding, “but it doesn’t have to be mine.” I can increase my chances for success by emulating the experiences of those who’ve already achieved success. I can also lessen my chances for failure by avoiding traits and habits of those who haven’t experienced the success I’d like to achieve. \nPutting pen to paper with my plans has always worked. I can’t recall a time when it has not. In fact, I can’t think of anyone I have met that doesn’t have the same experience. Planning is essential. I can do what I’ve done in the past and move without a plan. Things tend to work out, but not like I’d like. I continue to exist, but not thrive. I am alive, but not living life. Only existing. \nAbe Newmeyer has plans. Abe Newmeyer sets those plans to paper. He reviews his plans at least twice per day. Abe also moves towards completing those things needed to accomplish what’s been planned. He then scratches those things off his list and moves on. Abe doesn’t always complete the items in order, but inevitably, all items are completed.\nAffirming works well too. This iteration or evolution will require the aggregate of my experiences and that of others. Growing into His ideal image will require immense effort. Concentrated and sustained focus, intensity, and persistence. It will require more than I’ve done before as the benefits will be greater than I’ve received before. Free has no value and anything worth having has requisites. To do what’s required, no more, no less. To abide by the rules of the game, to show discipline, adherence to a code of conduct is what’s required. It’s what I, Abe Newmeyer, will do. \nToday, Monday, May 27, 2024, I am grateful that: \nMy edges are completed. I’m putting the other pieces in place, but for now the edges, my foundation if you will, is laid. \nI’m willing to share my experiences with complete strangers. That’s been something I’ve been reluctant to do for years, but as it stands today, no harm, no foul. I can’t think of a better, more effective means to fulfill my purpose. That, along with my hate of hypocrisy leads me to think and move on my current course. Some may not appreciate me leading my example, but those aren’t my audience or ideal client. I’m wanting to appeal to those willing to share the journey with me and develop an understanding of what's required to get to this point in the journey.\nMy weekend was productive.  It wasn’t bout relaxing, but working on becoming competent with resources needed for my edges. I did that happily and will continue to work on mastering the tools and skills needed to accomplish my mission.\nDo you have a plan?\nIs it handwritten?\nIf not, do that now.\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "Planning Progresses",
        "content": "Planning Progresses\nOver the last few weeks I’ve written about iterating. I’ve talked about how even though it’s not the ideal or perfect version of what I envision, I’ve been able to move forward, knowing I’ll iterate and work towards the ideal version at a later date. The same is true with planning. It’s been one of my shortcomings, deficits, or deficiencies. Pick a word, they’re all about the same for this situation.\nMy history includes an unwillingness or inability to properly plan. Mostly unwilling since I believe I have the ability. This time around, since my accident, I’ve put pen to paper. I’ve mapped out the organization, content, workflows, and a few other things. I’ve yet to set dates for completion, mostly because everything I’m doing is new and there's a learning curve for it all. More important than the deadlines are the actual plans. I’ve neglected to do those things previously. I’d chosen to live more carefree, less structured, or undisciplined. As a parent administers consequences for a child that doesn’t obey and adhere to the rules or code of conduct, my Creator has done the same for me. \nThere’s the yin and yang, light and dark, up and down or any other way you’d like to look at things. Basically, when I follow the code of conduct, the rules of the game, I’m rewarded and handsomely. When I do not follow the rules, I face the consequences. It’s simple. It’s straightforward. It’s also timeless. These types of relationships have existed throughout time. Before either of us were on the planet, they existed. After we’ve both completed this journey and are no longer here, they will still exist.\nA friend of my Dad’s often says, “Junior, if you’re gonna play the game, you’ve got to know the rules.” It’s true, but knowledge alone isn’t enough. I’ve learned you also have to follow or adhere to the rules. If you don’t know the rules, we’ve got to learn them, then we’ve got to follow them. Following them brings rewards we enjoy and not following them brings about consequences we do not enjoy. One of the rules is planning. Having said all that, I’m getting better at planning. \nPlanning, like just about everything else, is something that the more you do it, the better at it, or more proficient you become. When I did these things in the past, I often struggled, then delayed, then abandoned the planning altogether. Today, I can envision where I’m going, what it’ll take to get there, and the steps needed for each of those steps to get accomplished. It’s less time consuming. I won’t go so far as to say it's enjoyable, but it’s not as unpleasant as it’s previously been. \nPicture a toddler learning to walk. In the beginning they’re barely able to stand without falling. Then they can’t take small steps then fall. A bit more practice and they’re able to walk unassisted and without aid. Before too long, the little tyke is running about the house or yard wreaking havoc to the parents and delighting themselves. I’m far from Usain Bolt, but I’m also not struggling to stand and maintain my balance with planning. It’s progressing and so am I. \nToday, Wednesday, July 24, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI’ve got the first 50 projects identified. The plan is to launch with at least ten, but we’ll see how large I can get that number before month’s end. Great to make some progress.\nI got a chance to have dinner with Moe, Jess, and Owen yesterday. Good to see and be around the family environment. Nice to be back in the city around my friends and others I can relate to and have things in common with.\nThat’s it for today.\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "content": "Preparation, Planning, and Action\nYesterday I wrote about destiny. I provided the origin of the word and a few reasons for establishing or making firm your choice. I further emphasized the importance of deciding compared to choosing. One eliminates other options and for most of us when we don’t have a choice, we will do what’s needed no matter what. That’s a quick recap which I don’t typically do, but it’s not yesterday and it’s time to move forward. \nAfter you’ve made a decision and eliminated other options, the journey becomes much simpler and I’ll cover that a bit further down the road. This morning though, we’ll discuss preparation, planning, and putting it into action. To make ready is a fairly straightforward definition. You may think like I once did that preparation is about planning. If you had said that to me a few years ago, I would have agreed. Today, I know I have to make more than just an action plan.\nToday, I’m aware my entire being needs to be made ready. I’m physically capable of being the person, but not ready. I’m mentally capable of being the person, but not ready. I’m talking about moving with certainty towards your future self. Envisioning who you will become. How will you dress? Where will you live? How will you travel? Are you alone? If not, who will you travel with? Where will you dine? These are the types of things I’m referencing, because whether you can see it or not, plan means to arrange in advance. If you don’t know these things and a few others, how on earth will you get there?\nI’ve been ad hoc prepping and planning. It hasn’t been comprehensive, in part because I couldn’t see it and the other part was I didn’t know I needed to. You can bypass my frustration in this phase of your journey. You can be more exhaustive, more comprehensive from the very start. Fumbling around and gradually discovering these things is one way, or you can avoid the things I’ve done, that you don’t like. You can repeat the things I have done that you do like. “...and it doesn’t have to be your experience” is my addition to the old adage, experience is the best teacher.”\nAs things come into mind and you gain clarity, people and events will begin to fall into place. For instance, I’ve found my new place in the city. I’m temporarily living in a nearby location while it’s being built, but the funny thing is, I haven’t bought the place yet. I’ve met my personal chef and his father, we live in the same building now. My chef started his first year of culinary school and by the time he finishes his education, I’ll be able to offer him a position. It may appear grandiose or even delusional and it may very well be that you are correct. But on the off chance that I’m correct, I’ve prepared and planned for the moment. Have you?\nToday, Tuesday, August 13, 2024, I am grateful that:"

        "content": "Progress Is Essential\nWhen moving towards my purpose and its fulfillment, I’ve learned progress, even miniscule amounts, is still progress. Some may claim tremendous results are needed on a daily basis, but in my experience that hasn’t proven true. What I’ve learned is moving with immense effort makes me the “fastest sprinter” in a marathon. I’ve written about his before, but repeating it is never a bad thing. The reason is simple - I tend to forget some lessons. \nEach day is a gift, never to be repeated. Therefore, should I waste this day not doing at least one thing that moves me closer to fulfilling the reason I was put on the planet, I have squandered an opportunity which will never come again. The present is the gift. Fleeting into the ether of foggy memories and bygone glories told amongst family and friends, these glory days will not come again. \nI have to remember that my present today, my action today, my inconsistency, sloth, or grit and resilience, are what comprise my future tales. I can, and more than likely will, recount with great enthusiasm the overall period, but my definitive recollections, facts if you will, are these lists and the insights they provide. I’d thought about and read about writing letters to my future self. I’ve done those on an experiential basis, but for me, the effectiveness of writing consistent reasons for gratitude are proven and I am quite reluctant to change what’s worked so well. \nToday, Wednesday, January 3, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI made some progress on a project for Diana. It’ll become a keystone for her brand and I’m happy for the chance to serve. I’m also happy for the chance to work on my craft.\nI’m making progress towards my purpose and documenting it for others. The preliminary site is up and published and as the week progresses, I’ll be able to get a more suitable and professional site built. \nThe emergence of Abe is underway. Over the last few weeks I’ve found myself speaking in the third person. I’ve found myself defining attributes of my alter ego and it’s refreshing and empowering. This’ll prove educational.\nWhat progress have you made toward fulfilling your purpose today?\nIf the answer is nothing, do something now.\nAbe,\nBe Greater"

        "title": "Protect What’s Sacred",
        "content": "Protect What’s Sacred\nWhat do you treasure? What do you consider sacred? What or who would you fight to protect?\nFor me, there are only a few things. I don’t have a long list of family, friends, beliefs, and the like. When I speak of sacred and protecting those people or things or ideas and beliefs, I’m speaking of what’s most important to you? What’s vital? Those people or things essential for you, your happiness, your very existence. \nOne thing I’ve made sacred, setting aside time I considered hallowed, is the writing of these lists. Most days I listen to a playlist while writing. I sit, fingers on keyboard, and commune with my Creator. I get to do something many may take for granted. I get to improve my contact with the One who is all. It’s a hallowed time, a sacred time, a time I must protect. Today I did not.\nToday, I answered the phone when it rang. Basic enough tenet for life, if the phone rings, answer it. The trouble comes when it’s first thing in the morning or interrupts my sleep. My sacred time, my writing time, my communing with my Creator time, that’s first thing in the morning. That’s before showering, that’s before breakfast, and definitely before speaking with others. The challenge is when I’m working with someone with a two hour time zone difference, they don’t move on my schedule. \nWhen I first moved here, I turned off my phone. Simple solution for a time difference of about 12 or 13 hours. Now, with it only being two hours, it’s time to go back to what’s worked in the past. As a child, teenager, and adult, I’ve enjoyed asking questions and hearing stories from my elders. It always seemed as if they had some secret about life, work, relationships, and so much more. Now that I’m a bit older my thoughts are a bit different. One of the many benefits of getting and being older is experience. I have the experience to learn from my past. I can protect what’s sacred by doing something I’ve done in the past. Experience is a great thing.\nToday, Tuesday, January, 30, 2024, I am grateful that: \nI got the first drafts of a couple documents finished for a client. The wake up call to let me know there’s more to be done, but at least we’re not starting from scratch. Work is work and that’s probably the reason it’s a four letter word.\nI got a little work done on my freelancing contract. It’ll be a truncated work week, but I’ll easily hit the numbers for this client. A four day work week sounds like something off the Jetsons cartoon, but this week it is reality and not cartoon based fiction.\nI was able to fellowship a bit for Kelvin’s birthday party. He had a day long celebration. I wasn’t able to hang out all day, but I got a chance to say hello to the noon crowd and eat dinner with the evening crowd. It was good, I’m guessing, for him to have such a turnout for his birthday.\nReread the questions from the beginning.\nAbe, \nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "Purge To Surge",
        "content": "Purge To Surge\nThere’s a movie about some climbers summiting Mount Everest. Their guide told them when transitioning from Base Camp Two to Base Camp Three to back minimal items. He emphasized the importance of carrying only what was needed. “Be brutal, one pound down here is ten pounds on the mountain” or something like that. He wanted his climbers to lessen their loads as much as possible, without jeopardizing themselves or their task at hand. \nIn life, we’re the climbers. We carry all sorts of things, from childhood until death. The lessons of scarcity, fear, abundance, not being good enough, being too quiet, too loud, and all sorts of other things we picked up as we move up this metaphorical mountain. As we continue our ascend, climbing higher and higher, striving to accomplish more and more, those things we’d been carrying before become amplified. Intensified by the trials we face and the heights we’ve reached, our fear, our anger, our limiting beliefs begin to weigh us down in ways we could not have imagined or even had to deal with previously. \nIn order to continue our ascent up this mountain, we must purge. We got to be brutal like the movie scene. Those limiting beliefs, the fear and anger, and even the people have to be set aside or left behind. They served us well until that point, but to make our ascent, to get to our ultimate destination, we must purge. \nAfter the purge, we surge. Our shoulders and minds freed from the burdens we’d been carrying, we surge forward. For some it’s a sprint, but the journey, the climb is still wrought with danger we can do more, in more challenging conditions than we could before, but the climb is still tough. \nLater in the movie, there are a couple of scenes when you see climbers that didn’t make it to the top. They were left on the mountain. There’s another scene when climbers leave fellow climber behind. These tragedies illustrate something for us on our journey. Some won’t make it with you to the top. They won’t be around for your entire journey. You will not be able to continue with them and you will not be able to carry them. You will jeopardize yourself, your mission, and your destination will not be reached, should you choose to do so. \nI’m still climbing. The air has gotten thin, it’s harder to breath, and it seems as if each step takes more than I possess. I’ve walked past some along my climb. I’ve left a left a few behind. Those climbing in high school or college or my first or second career have been purged. Others are being purged since the accident last year. I’m certain more will be left on the mountain. Purge comes from a Latin word meaning to clear away, cleanse, or to purify. Do that with those emotions, feelings, people, places, and things bogging you down. Clear away those things that will make your journey more challenging. \nToday, Monday, February, 17, 2025, I am grateful that:\nAlmost all the items are out of my old place. I’m settled into my new place which is oddly familiar. \nThe weekend was restful. I haven’t been resting well, but this weekend, last night in particular, I rested well. Less on my mind and the reality of some of my decisions are being cemented into my mind.\nThis feeling of nostalgia isn't fading. I’d done the same things before like selling car or life insurance, but the is oddly different. It’s not the same as before and if it actually is, I’m not going back to search through old gratitude lists to find out how I felt about something a decade ago. It’s great to not be dominated by my emotions or feelings. \nAbe, \nBe Greater!!\nP.S. The movie is Everest, released in 2015."

        "content": "Putting It All Together\nYesterday, I wrote about being able to see the complete picture, the entire puzzle if you will. I wrote how I could envision all the pieces of the puzzle coming together to form a completed and quite beautiful picture. I haven’t had this type of clarity of vision in years, maybe longer. It’s refreshing, but also a bit frightening at the same time. Refreshing because I can clearly see how all the hours invested will begin to provide returns. Frightening because I’m well aware of the amount of work required to put this particular puzzle together. \nThis puzzle will require stretching in ways I haven’t stretched before. It’ll require growth in areas that are atrophied. It’ll require stimulation of those areas along with intense and extended exercise. It’ll also require the development of areas I thought I had mastered and falsely believed it to be true. Finally, it’ll require the most challenging, yet vital part of it all, schedule a honest and fearless assessment of my situation at least quarterly, but maybe more often.\nI’m certain there will be other opportunities, but I’m not entirely certain of my desire to continue to pursue them. I’ve had more than my fair share of said opportunities in the past. I’ve squandered most of them. As I sit and envision this particularly opportunity, how things have become quite clear, the lasting impact it’ll provide myself and others, I’m hard pressed to NOT take full advantage of it. This aligns perfectly at this stage of my development with my objective. Not taking full advantage would be akin to spiritual suicide. \nMost, if not all, of the stress and anxiety I feel is in my mind. I’ve put an immense amount of pressure on myself to make this work. The trick is, whether it works or not is irrelevant. Putting it all together and taking the action is what’s relevant. I’m in the action business. He handles results!\nToday, Tuesday, May 20, 2024, I am grateful that:\nVigor is returning. One of the things that’s happened before and it’s happening now is my increased energy levels. Waking up before the alarm and getting things done while most are sleeping is something I haven’t done in years. It’s a great feeling albeit fleeting. \nThe possibility of what I’m doing now can benefit others years from now. Planting a seed takes little effort, but the germination, growth, and blossoming of the plant could take decades. It’s great to be in the planting business. \nI get to wear two or more hats at the moment. I’m not only planting for my next harvest, but I’m also harvesting what’s in the field. I’ve been putting in the work for years now and reaping what I’ve sown is at hand. The business of others is not my concern. My concern is doing what I was put on this planet to accomplish. I can tend my business and leave others to do the same. \nCan you see how what you’re doing now fits into the overall picture?\nIf not, have you contemplated this quietly?\nHow will this help me accomplish my mission?\nAsk yourself this question repeatedly. Your answer will be revealed.\nAbe, \nBe Greater!!!"

Both were in agreement I should raise my rate, but incremental steps were needed. While I was just writing this, the thought occurred to me that, with regard to raising my standards, I need to do that with my communication style. \nMost, if not all of the people speaking with me, require further explanation of my thoughts or ideas. I definitely have a deficiency when it comes to articulating my thoughts, concepts, and ideas to others. I’m actually struggling to finish this writing since the thought just occurred. My current, and some of my past challenges, may be directly related to my inability to articulate them to others in a position to facilitate their completion. \nYears ago, while an outpatient getting my medication readjusted, I had to attend these group therapy sessions. The guy leading the group, Patrick, had us perform an active listening exercise. It was a variant of others I’d learned from Sales training in a couple of organizations, but still sticks out in my mind. Each of us was asked to speak uninterrupted for 90 seconds as our partner listened. Patrick then asked the person listening to repeat what was said. With rare exception, no one got it back verbatim or even in its essence. \nThe purpose of the exercise was profound. What we speak and what is heard are, more often than not, two different things. This is in just short bursts of 90 seconds, not to mention longer monologues which can happen quite often with friends and colleagues. Another friend using an extremely effective technique. After you speak, John says, “What I heard you say was…” he then repeats what he heard you say. Afterwards, he ask, “Is that correct” or “Did I hear you correctly?” \nMoving forward, I will raise my standards. Raising my standards for communicating, delivering service, and delivering value will be top of mind. I am willing to bet that elevating my message delivery will directly and exponentially raise my income. I’m also guessing it’ll help me become more effective in fulfilling my purpose and act as n accelerate. \nToday, Tuesday, January 23, 2024, I am grateful that:\nVictoria and I got a chance to catch up for a bit yesterday. I provided an update on my progress on an endeavor we’re embarking on together. She was happy with the progress and grateful for the update. She provided some insights and I’m happy she was able to share her experience. \nThe epiphanies I’d been getting from and during writing these lists have returned. In the last week it’s happened a couple of times and I didn’t know I missed it until it was gone and then returned. “You never miss your water, ‘til your well runs dry” is the adage that comes to mind.\nI’m beginning to recall, remember, and relive the greatness which I have achieved. I am not resting on my laurels. But to turn a blind eye to what I’ve accomplished, in essence, shuns the greatness He has facilitated. For my Creator to be proud of what I’ve done, by getting out of his way, is really something to strive for. \nWhat are your standards? In your career, your personal life, education, career, spiritual life…what are your standards?\nAfter writing each of those down, do this:\nHow can you raise your standards in each area?\nAbe, \nBe Greater!!!"

        "content": "Random Versus Intentional\nAbout a month ago, I met a young lady while outside watching fireworks. It was the end of Sinulog, a festival here in Cebu City, and we got a chance to meet and talk to each other that night. The fireworks were great and so was the conversation. Over the next week or so we’d have these chance encounters and they were always delightful. \nEach time, we’d claim we’d only smoke another cigarette then head on our separate way, but some of our conversations would last for an hour ot two, maybe even longer. During one of our talks I posed a question, “How can we do this, but not so random?” He response was we can not. She stated she like the random aspect and as a man, pretty women seem to always get the way as far as I’m concerned. One or two more chance encounters since then and I’ve since moved to another condo. \nWe haven’t seen each other or spoken in a couple of weeks. I think of her often and what I’ve come to realize is a bit of a life lesson. Random is great. Random can be delightful and enjoyable.. Random means, among other things, unfamiliar or unspecified. It also means done or chosen without method or conscious decision. Our conversations were great, but by definition, they were random. For nearly a decade now, I’ve been living with purpose. I’ve been living with clarity and intent. Another way of saying that is I’ve been very methodical or deliberate. These are the opposite of random. \nSo although delightful and fun and mostly fulfilling and enjoyable, our conversations were not aligned with my life and my lifestyle. I will miss our conversations. I will miss the dialogue. What I won’t miss is randomness. It’s not aligned with every other aspect of my life. As I move forward I’ve got to be mindful of my reason for being. My purpose. My existence isn’t random and those people, places, and things not aligned to facilitate the achievement of my purpose, those random things, may truly be an enjoyable respite, but they are more of a distraction than anything else. \nRemain vigilant in the pursuit of your purpose. Stay alert and guard your time, your heart, and your mind. Distractions come in varying forms, but your purpose comes in one form. Do all you can each day to complete or fulfill the reason for which you exist. \nToday, Wednesday, February 19, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI am well rested. I’ve fully transferred all my belongings to my newest location. slept during the day and woke up ready to work tonight. It seems as if my adjusting well to my old familiar surroundings \nThe lesson about random and intention came to mind. I’d been obsessing over if I’d done something wrong or inappropriate. I’d been thinking about how I can do things better, more effectively and the like. The lesson this morning is more about intent, which is my objective. Random and deliberate do not coexist. \nI landed another small contract. I’ll work on emulating Mark and his success. His plan is several small contracts at once versus one big contact. He figures that if one cancels it’s less challenging to replace a five hour contract over a twenty hour contract. It’s worked well for him and I may as well take the same approach. \nHow can you live with intent today?\nWhat deliberate action can you take today?\nHow will that action move you closer to completing your purpose?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

Now that I’m certain what “it” is, I\\ll map out a plan and get to work. This life has been challenging. The last few months have been particularly tough, but I’m still here. I will continue doing what I was created to do as noone else will fulfill my purpose. Resilient means able to withstand or recover quickly from difficult conditions. I don’t typically have a problem with definitions, but quickly is subjective. \nIn this moment, two months seems like forever. In the grand scheme of my life, two months is one of 312 parts of my life, as a fraction it’s approximately 0.003 of my entire life so far. That’s if I were to drop dead while writing this. It’s three one thousandths of my life on the planet so far, not a full percentage yet. It’s temporary, short term, and I guess if recovering took another four months or 0.01 of my life so far, it still wouldn’t be a full one percent. A bit of arithmetic is soothing and when I look at the numbers, because I had to use a calculator, it seems so small. Not one percent, not a full percentage. Of the 624 months I’ve been on the planet, I’m talking about two, maybe four or possibly six. So maybe, in terms of life and textbook definitions of quickly, like the dictionary, it’s possible I am resilient by the purest definition of the word.\nThe point I’m making is life happens. It will become difficult or challenging. Some days will be easier or less challenging than others. Each day is different from the last. No matter the circumstances of the day, you and I must remain resilient. We must! Do not surrender your hope. Do not surrender the possibilities of what’s to come! Do not yield to temporary circumstances. The next day, tomorrow will be different from today. You can live to fight another day, but only if you keep going. I have learned each of my past experiences makes me better equipped for future occurrences. “That which does not kills, make you stronger” comes to mind. I have not stopped yet and I have wanted to. I keep going. Call it idiocy, insanity, or resilience, I do not call about the labels. I care about moving forward no matter the costs. No matter the situation, I will not surrender. No matter the current circumstances, it’s only temporary since every single day is different from the last and unique unto itself.\nToday, Monday, April 7, 2024, I am grateful that:\nThe weekend was restful. I got a chance to formulate a plan for the next few weeks. Things are going to start moving more quickly and I won’t have this idle time like now. I am doing my part to make sure I can maximize my physical and mental health.\nThere is light at the end of the tunnel and it’s not a locomotive in route to run me over. It seems like that some days, but feelings change and fact do not. The basic math I did earlier remind me that this is only a short in comparison to my entire life. I know from experience this is only temporary.\nJan and I got a chance to talk yesterday. We hadn't spoken in probably a year. It felt good to catch up with and confide in someone that’s known me for such a long time. We’ve both been living our lives and it’s reat we had some time to catch up with each other.\nWhen it’s tough, do you remember it’s only temporary?\nHave you done the math?\nHow long has this tough spot been going? What percentage of your life is it? \nWhen you seen the percentage of fraction, how much hope does that provide?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "content": "Revitalized\nMeaning to imbue something with new life and vitality, I’m curious if I’m revitalized. I’m actually up and writing, like the old days. I haven’t done this in a few weeks. I’ve been in a bit of a funk. The incident yesterday with the stranger from Peru may have sparked something. I wrote about it yesterday and I’ll only give a quick summary here.\nA stranger needed help. The help he needed was more than I could offer. I asked others to assist. One didn’t answer my call, another said no. I help how I could and we parted ways. He when you can; some tasks require more than you have and you have to get help; some will not help in your tasks; and do what you can do and move on. There may be other lessons, but those are the ones that resonate with me today and yesterday. \nI’m here to make a positive and lasting impact. It’s my purpose, my reason for existing. A buddy of mine reminds me often that “we’re ambassadors” as we deal with the locals. An ambassador is an accredited diplomat sent by a country as its official representative to a foreign county. A diplomat is an official representing a country abroad. I could consider myself an accredited official representing Him everywhere I go. \nThe way I speak, the walk I dress, the way I interact with others are all representative of Him. I’m living and working towards the reason I was created by Him. If I can’t do those things and represent Him in the process, as an ambassador if you will, then what am I doing? I’m not with a religious entity so I wouldn’t consider myself an “official” representative, but I would consider myself an unofficial representative. \nIf that’s the case and my job is to make a positive and lasting impact on the lives of others, I believe I succeeded with at least one yesterday. It may not be something that happens daily on a personal level, but it may. My interactions may become less and less frequent as I delve into these projects, but I did what was required yesterday. I’ll keep moving forward, imbued or inspired with a new vitality or in the literal definition of the word, the state of being strong and active. In simpler terms, I’ll keep moving forward in a state of being strong and active.\nToday, Thursday, September 26, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI’m back to writing. It offers a sense of accomplishment on days when I am not very productive. It’s also a way to get things out of my head and onto something more tangible. \nI’m getting some sense of direction. It’s not as if I’ve been lost, but more clarity is a good thing. \nI ran into the guy from Peru yesterday. Our exchange offered some valuable insights and it got me starting to write once more. \nLessons are becoming clearer. Some I needed to recall, others I needed to learn. It’s funny how I can hear or read just the right thing at just the right time from just the right person.\nAre you in a spot where you’d like to stop?\nWhat can you do to keep going?\nDo one of those things right now.\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "content": "Saying Goodbye\nFor what it’s worth, I’m not one of those people that think and treat animals as if they are people. We had pets during my childhood, dogs and cats, but I have never treated them like they were my kids or something. When I moved into my new place, one of the cats had kittens. The momma cat was killed by a car and left behind two kittens. I basically adopted them and have been feeding and caring for them for at least six months. Last night one was hit by a car. It’s slightly disconcerting. \nSaturday I had a conversation with Diana. She reminded me to follow my heart and not my head, to quit overthinking things, and to take action. Sunday I had a similar conversation with Victoria. Disconcerting means to cause one to feel unsettled and that’s what’s happened over this weekend. First Diana then the death of Max and finally Victoria,all three have left me unsettled. \nFor the majority of Sunday instead of watching television and charging the battery, I worked on my inaugural course. The outline is completed along with five or six of the collateral for nine of the modules. Today I only have to finish the remaining collateral and record the audio. Based on some feedback, I may need to make some changes, but I’ll have a viable product before I go to sleep tonight. In this instance, I followed my heart. \nI’m really big and think it’s paramount to look up the definition of words. The have power and if I wield that power carelessly, the consequences are undesirable. While preparing my outline, I came across a synonym personify. Originally used to give human qualities to something not human, it came to mean to embody a quality, concept, ot thing in huma form or with human characteristics. One of the opposites is from a French word meaning to unfasten or to separate, like disconnecting or separating from someone or something emotionally or mentally. \nAfter viewing my accident video footage, I firmly believe I was spared from death. I thought and began using my new moniker and started informing those closest to me to please address me by my new name since the old me died on February the first. I’d begun to dehumanize my old self, but hadn’t fully embraced or personified my new self. That starts today. \nI’m saying goodbye to the old version of myself. I’ll embrace being Abe Newmeyer. The man that lives with conviction and moves with intention. Abe moves and acts with clarity of thoughts. Abe is a strategist and lives that way. His plans encompass varying tactics to fulfill his purpose. The old me didn’t do that, but this newest evolution eats, lives, breathes, and sleeps in that manner. Grieving can last a day or a decade and the choice is yours. Abe Newmeyer has finished grieving!\nToday, Monday, May 6, 2024, I am grateful that:\nMy weekend was productive. Most weekends are filled with relaxation. Me, my remote, and the TV get reacquainted. This was a most welcomed departure for the normal.\nWorking on the course really helped flesh out my thoughts for the book. I’m probably doing them in reverse order but as long as they are both completed, the order of completion is irrelevant.\nEven though I didn’t upload any of the content I’d planned to before the weekend, what I did upload will be more impactful and beneficial. \nAre you willing to dehumanize those traits which don’t benefit you?\nHow will you grieve that loss?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

Two have come to fruition after several months of possibilities and one during a conversation a bit earlier today. The interesting thing is one is immediately executable. The second can take a bit of time, but could prove profitable and produce a residual income stream. The last opportunity from a conversation earlier could have an immense impact, not just for myself but for a minimum of millions of people on an annual basis. \nI’ll take the low lying fruit first. It’s simple, straightforward, and requires the least amount of work. Additionally, I can implement this within a week and start seeing results before the end of the month. The next opportunity isn’t entirely within my control, same with the third opportunity. So although potential, waiting for so many moving parts to align will require tons of planning and patience. \nWhen making decisions about how to invest my time, effort, and energy, I have to take some time and run through a risk, reward analysis. I have my process for evaluations. If you don’t have a process, I’d suggest you find and use one. \nToday, Monday, January 8, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI got a chance to talk to Sherman earlier. From our conversation, an incredible opportunity to help the residents and visitors of this island. Before week’s end  more information will be obtained regarding feasibility.\nVictoria and I had a chance to speak. Told her about the chance to get the dinosaur egg salt and she was definitely thrilled to have it at the ready.\nTo watch NFL highlights and relax. Didn’t order pizza, but that’s totally ok as well. Ate leftover barbecue.\nHad a chance to eat and hang out yesterday with Poe and a bunch of the usual suspects. Fantastic food and fellowship, as always..\nSaturday I had a chance to attend the graduation of Rian. His commencement address carried the same message of hope we’ve all heard many times. It was great to hear it again and realize that even at 30 years thars they’re senior I am hopeful for the future and the possibilities it holds.\nHow do you evaluate opportunities?\nWhen was the last time you used that method to choose the route to take?\nHow or would you change that decision today?\nAbe,\nBe Greater"

        "title": "Setting The Stage",
        "content": "Setting The Stage\nPreparation is key vital. Embarking on any endeavor, worthy or not, requires preparation. Preparation is defined as the process of making ready or being made ready for use or consideration. Another definition is the state of being prepared, but when you go a bit deeper, it gets better. Prepared means subjected to a special process or treatment. When we put that together we get “the state of being subjected to a special process” or “the state of being subjected to a special treatment.”  Our treatment is, or will be special. The reason, most are not prepared.\nFirst job selling Life Insurance was with an agency that specialized selling to farmers and ranchers in Texas. We used a script. A script for the phone calls, a script for the sales presentation, a script for overcoming objections. We had a script for just about everything. At the time the state allowed you to sell on a temporary license. It may have been valid for about 90 days. The agency provided a training cassette tape and I listened and listened and committed it all to memory. My first week in sales, I made about $1200 for three days work. I was sold on selling life insurance. But I wasn’t prepared. The stage wasn’t set.\nI took another week or so and studied for the Life Insurance exam. I took a prep course, studied at home, and became immersed with the material. I passed the exam on my first attempt. I happily called the instructor from the prep course and told him I scored something the mid eighties. He jokingly replied, “You studied too much” since I only needed a seventy to pass the exam. I embarked on a career selling Life Insurance which helped set the stage for other careers.\nSome work needs to be completed before other work can be done. A lumberjack doesn’t pull out an axe or chainsaw and start cutting. A doctor doesn’t start performing surgery or writing prescriptions for patients. Athletes practice. Actors do as well. Performers have rehearsals. Sprinters and runners stretch before a race. They ready themselves via a special process. As a professional, I must do the same thing. If I don’t, I lose credibility. I erode and erase all trust with incompetence. I will not lead a career that way. I’ve never done that and there’s no reason to start doing so now.\nYou and I are not at step one or zero though. There are things we’ve done before which can help on just about any endeavor we are beginning. For me, my experience form sales, presentations, writing, and a few others help me deliver my messages more effectively. For you, well, you will have to determine those things on your own. I will venture a guess and say you have skills you can stack. Something you’ve already mastered may become a building block or cornerstone of what you aspire to build now. It takes a bit of time to assess, but it’ll prove worthwhile when setting the stage for your newest endeavor.\nToday, Wednesday, April 10, 2024, I am grateful that: \nVictoria and I spoke yesterday. Technically it’s earlier today for those in the states, but for me it was last night. I really enjoyed our conversation and I’m happy we both find something during each call that’s mutually beneficial.\nMy community concept is becoming more concrete and complete. Today, I’ll map out my action steps for a launch and get at least one more thing finished for said launch.\nI almost have complete use of my right hand. I still can’t type with my ring or pinky fingers, but the pain is tolerable today. A month ago, I could only use my pointer finger, but the adage “time heals all wounds” is proving somewhat true so far. \nAre you prepared?\nWhat is your preparation process?

It feels as if I’m home and I’ve been here, versus having just moved two days ago. Later today or at some point next week, I may search for something and can’t find it easily. But today, everything has and is, in its place. \nOne thing I do well is something another struggles with. One thing someone else does well may very will be something another does quite effortlessly. I hate cleaning, organizing, and all things along those lines. Shirley excelled in that area. So did Veronica, Jovy, my Mom, and tons of other people, male and female alike. It’s something I have never enjoyed or done well. To have all my things unpaced and put up and look like it does now is a great feeling. It’s one less thing that needs to be done. I’m settling in. I’m back to where I’ve been before. \nMy settling is lateral and figurative. I’m moved into and good with my new environment, but I’m also settling into the need for a smaller circle. I’m settling into the idea that I can’t be available to all. I’m settling into the idea that my experience has value. I’m settling into the idea that my days a literally numbers and I’ve got far fewer days remaining today than I’ve had at any time in my past. I’t not depressing, nor does it create anxiety or anything along those lines. It’s an acknowledgement or acceptance of truth. \nI’ve got less time today than I’ve every had. The flip side of that coin, if you will, is I’ve never had more experience than I possess right now. I struggle with recalling all I’ve done and done wll. I struggle with valuing my experiences, tragic and triumphant. My struggle doesn’t mean the value is diminished, it means I have to settle into the idea and reality of setting a proper monetary value on those experiences. My victories and defeats have immense value to others on the path today. \nI have to settle into the idea, practiced by others for centuries, of being compensated properly for the value I deliver. Serving my community is what I desire. I can and will be able to serve my community and be able to receive compensation. I have to settled into that idea.\nToday, Friday, February 14, 2025, I am grateful that:\nWalked around a bit and it’s different but familiar. New stores and venues, but he same location near the complex. New people, but lots of the old familiar faces as well. \nHerb and I had a weekly conversation. He said I sounded more optimistic than the prior week. Mutually beneficial conversation as always and happy it’s continued for as long as it has.\nThe light at the end of the tunnel isn’t a locomotive. I say it in jest, but all seriousness as well. It’s been a challenging twelve monts and being able to see the close of one cycle and another upcoming brings joy to my heart.\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "Slow Progress Is Still Progress",
        "content": "Slow Progress Is Still Progress\nThis weekend brought about the realization that things aren’t going as fast as planned. On the physical rehab front, it’s so slow I’m a bit discouraged. Being unable to function normally is taking its toll on the work front in particular. I’d been working on a project and was waiting for a couple of things to fall in place and then I’d be able to submit the first draft of the project. The first draft isn’t up to my standards, it’s good but not GREAT, and I refuse to send it over to a potential partner. \nWith a lack of financial reserves, the stress is diverting my attention from the project, increasing my anxiety, and making me generally discontent. Last week I submitted a request through a government agency for assistance on the legal front. This weekend I received three calls from the police attempting to negotiate on behalf of the company. I explained the situation repeatedly and told them to contact my attorney. After all things falling in place and rendering my first draft videos, I happy that the draft if completed, albeit inadequate, but it’s at least something.\nThe moral of the story is slow progress is still progress. I’m further along today than I was a week or a month ago. Five months ago I was hospitalized and unable to walk without assistance. That’s not the issue today. Three months ago the videos were a far fletched idea, maybe induced by all the pain medication, today the first drafts are completed just not the quality I’d hoped for or expected. Five months ago, the trucking company owners were ignoring negligence and liability. Well, that’s still the case, but at least another government agency is involved and increasing the intensity. Five months ago paying for my medical bills out of pocket depleted my savings and put me in debt. Today, my savings are nonexistent, I have more debt, but I’ll be able to generate an income soon enough.\nSome days it’s easy to only see one side of the coin. Some days it’s easy to lean towards the negative slant on things. Some days are not today. Today, I’m sitting with keys on my laptop and typing, but I couldn’t even do that three months ago, so it’s progress. It’s slow, it’s frustrating and it’s my journey. No other is equipped like me for this journey. It’s mine and mine alone and I’ll continue trudging.\nToday, Monday, July 8, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI’ve already begun reworking the project. It’s a bit time consuming, but I’m making progress. \nThe weekend was relaxing. Met a few new people on vacation. The great thing about being in the middle of the city again is the camaraderie. I’m not about hanging out and socializing much, but it’s good to have the option and exercise it occasionally.\nI got a chance to talk to my cousin Frank today. We hadn’t spoken in years and although I’d asked my brother to reached out to them, no one had. We caught up and he’s nearing retirement. I told him that I’m still paying my dues and I’ll be there soon.\nAre you able to see your progress?\nAre you able to see where your destination?\nIf it’s going slower than you’d like, what steps can you take to accelerate your journey?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

I’m still months away and it seems as if things are taking forever. It’s challenging to not get depressed. It’s challenging to wake up with vigor. It’s challenging to keep going. It’s just challenging. And that may simply be the story of life.\nThings may appear close. They may seem within reach. They may be palpable. Continuing on with the mission, despite challenges, in spite of obstacles, when it’s tough, that’s the real challenge. Pushing forward when what you desire is so close, but so far. That ability to not yield, to not surrender, to do what’s needed and keep going, that perseverance is something most don’t possess. \nQuitting is not an option. When the pantry is empty, when the bank account is embarrassingly low or negative, when friends and family say you should stop, that’s when it’s time to ante up. That’s when it’s time to do even more. To not surrender. If you’re on a most high mission, an objective for your Creator, if you’re working towards fulfilling your purpose, quitting would mean there’s no reason to exist. \nPurpose is the reason for which something or someone was created. If I stop working towards doing what I’m on this Earth to accomplish, there’s no reason for me to be alive. With that being said, if you’re a bit discouraged, if you’re a bit tired, or frustrated, and wondering if it’s worth it, think about you’re reason for being on the planet. Think about how you can move towards accomplishing that which you were created to get done. Others may come close, but you will complete the task. You and I are made of incredible stuff. We’re comprised of all that’s needed to accomplish our task. It’ll be uncomfortable. It’ll be frustrating. It’ll be close and far at the same time. Do not yield. Do not surrender. Do your absolute best. Each and everyday, make progress towards your purpose. \nToday, Wednesday, July 3, 2024, I am grateful that:\nMy resolve is emerging once again. I hadn’t quit, but I definitely haven’t been living the same way I was living to get here. I guess I got a bit laxed and so happy that’s no longer the case.\nLiz and I got a chance to talk a little earlier. We’ve known each other for nearly forty years. It’s weird to think how old I’ve gotten and it’s an honor that I’ve got more than a handful of relationships that are over thirty years old. She’s one of them and so happy we got a chance to talk today.\nI’m getting more settled into my new place. The environment itself is uplifting. It’s given me renewed vigor. It’s provided a resurgence, a renewal of my previous self with more experiences and urgency. \nCan you see the finish line?\nDoes it seem impossibly far?\nWhat’s one or two steps you can take and move closer to your finish line today?\nTake that step!!!\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "content": "Some Days Are Tougher Than Others\nEarlier today, had a conversation with a neighbor. Cool guy, but he was having a bit of a challenging day. The last couple of our interactions, he was having a challenging day. I’m not sure if you’ve had similar interactions, but when I’ve had them in the past, I deal with them in the following the ways. \nMy first option is always to listen. Afterwards, I offer a solution. As I offer my solution or solutions, I watch the body language and mannerisms of whomever I’m speaking to. When I notice unresponsive or unreceptive reactions to the solutions I’ve actually experienced and how they’ve worked for me, I begin to end the interaction. Herb likes to say, “I don’t know how much time I’ve got left, but I don’t want to spend any of it on this.”\nAfter hearing a problem, as a man, as a servant, and as someone with an abundance of life’s experiences, I usually want to offer solutions. I believe in moving forward. I believe in taking action. I believe and shared this with my neighbor earlier, “You can’t think your way into right acting. You have to act your way into right thinking.” It’s about action, action, and more action. Inaction, whether it’s a solution I’m offering or something you come up with on your own, is an action. Choosing to stay in the problem, whatever that may be, is not acceptable. \nAny of my efforts or time invested into problems, with no solutions, are a waste. I’m not willing to waste my breath, my expertise, my energy into people unwilling to take positive action. If you want to remain focused on a problem, feel free to do so. I will personally focus on solutions and taking action to implement those solutions. I’d suggest you do something similar.\nToday, Tuesday, January 9, 2024, I am grateful that: \nI’m able to discern those I want to be around and those I do not. If I’m wanting to get to where I need to be, I will not be able to waste time with those interested in staying in the problem and not the solution.\nI’m am writing again. It feels tedious, but that’s more that I’m writing for my audience versus enhancing my relationship with my Creator,which was my original intent. I’ll keep writing though and more than likely find another way of enhancing my relationship.\nEven when I don’t feel like doing something, like this list, I do it anyway. A week from now and definitely a decade from today, the only way I’ll remember how I felt about this list is to actually read it. Feelings are temporary, facts are permanent. \nHow do you remove yourself from people focused on their problems?\nDo you focus on your problems?\nWhat about solutions?

        "title": "Spilled Milk",
        "content": "Spilled Milk\nYesterday I spoke with Daniel. He’d started doing some research about the insurance industry. He’d already selected his niche, knew the commission structure, and wanted to ask a few questions. I shared some insights and then he asked, “Why aren’t you doing this?” He became apologetic, thinking I would be offended. “I couldn’t renew my license when I was out of the country” was my response. It’s true, but not complete.\nAnother part of the answer ties into me being able to do something I hadn’t done in well over three months. I was able to wear my tennis shoes. My accident ins February resulted in many wounds, including a broken right arm and lots of abrasions on my right leg and foot. My right foot has healed enough and even though it’s not fully functional, I was able to use my right hand to tie my shoes. Seemingly unrelated, both illustrate my point. I have taken some things for granted and didn’t come to appreciate those things until they were gone.\nI definitely took the life insurance business for granted. The ability to make the amount of money I did, in the short timeframes is something I’ve yet to match in another industry. I bounced around in several niches with life insurance, but never selected one to drill down and establish my expertise. That may be a bit more challenging to relate to than making a knot while tying your shoe. Definitely something I took for granted. The same could be said for my health. I’ve had covid twice and never felt my life was in jeopardy. Quite a different perspective than laying in a hospital bed and not knowing where I was, what happened, or being in pain with every breath. \nThose instances bring me back to “don’t cr over spilled milk” and another, “what’s done is done.” It may very well be part of human nature to take things for granted. Even with the habit of writing a gratitude list five days a week, I took my physical well being for granted. “Taking for granted” means to assume something as true, real, unquestionable, or to be expected. I assumed my production in the life insurance business  was to be expected. I never questioned my ability to tie my shoes. I always expected to be in good health. A bit of time and life circumstances has shed light on the fact that things change. \nDaniel did something I never did too. He selected his niche, did research, and was in the process of collecting information before making a decision. Me on the other hand, I jumped without looking repeatedly. From supplemental life and health policies in rural Texas to small life insurance policies then term insurance in the guise of mortgage protection coverage then traditional life insurance policies again and finally ending with ObamaCare. Varied experiences but not much in financial benefits. \nYou can do what I’ve done, leaping without looking from one opportunity to the next. It’ll provide lots of excitement, some stress, and the rewards may or may not be something you want to receive. Or, you can do like Daniel and many others, research your next endeavor, choose how to specialize, and gather all the information you require to make an informed decision. \nToday, Tuesday, May 7, 2024, I am grateful that: \nI’m learning some new lessons about myself and those I choose to be around. I say be around versus invest time with since it’s how I’d viewed those relationships in the past. Moving forward, I’ll begin viewing my time with others as an investment. As a former Financial Advisor part of my training and my job was to evaluate the return on investment. When the amount received in exchanged isn’t satisfactory, it’s a poor investment and that’s how I’ll determine those I invest time with moving forward. \nI went for a walk in tennis shoes yesterday. Not that thrilling of a walk, but the mere fact of tying my shoes is the triumph. Small as it may sound, I am happy I was able to do it with relatively little pain. \nMy first online course is nearly completed. I’d thought often about systemizing what’s worked well and sharing what hasn’t. My past includes tons of verbal communication of the sme. With my new perspective on residual income, this modified plan is and will work nicely. It affords me the chance to share success principles, my experiences with and without their proper application, and generate a residual income. Work once and get paid forever. An honest days work for an hoest days pay means I’ll have to work until I die and that’s unacceptable.\nHow much time do you spend thinking about spilled milk? Could you lessen that amount of time?\nList a couple of things or people that if taken away today and for the next month and then returned, you’d have a challenging time expressing your gratitude?\nAbe,\nBe Greater"

        "content": "Start With The Edges\nYears ago when I was a kid, my older brother would assemble these seemingly impossible 1000 piece puzzles. For me at five or six years old it appeared as if he was a genius. I don’t recall how many puzzle pieces my puzzles had, but in no way, shape, form or fashion were they 1000 pieces. I asked my brother how he could put together such a difficult puzzle and he told me to “start with the edges.” He then said something like, “After the edges, take your time putting the inside pieces in place.”\nA similar principle can be applied to building my business. Top of the gunnel, mid funnel, operations, scalability, sales, marketing, and all those other things have a place. But, which ones form the edges. I’ve yet to find anyone that contradicts, and I agree with, the Jay Abraham concept regarding three ways to grow your business. \nIn its essence, increase the number of customer, the number of times they buy, and increase the frequency which they purchase. That could be three of the four edges of the puzzle. They won’t be my three pieces, but they may be yours.\nAs you go about adopting and working towards fulfilling your most High mission, lessons will be revealed. In my case something from over forty years ago applies. More will be revealed as you trudge your path. Your intuition, your ingenuity, and your reasons for doing what you’re doing will provide insights from your past and present. Your mind and mine enjoys solving puzzles. \nWhen we set it to a task and become obsessed in completing that task, it’ll solve the how portion. Sustained focus and the ability to persevere will grow for you, as they have for me. Failures will fade away from your mind as they become lessons, experiences you can repeat or avoid. Your puzzle pieces will begin to fall into place. The bigger picture, the puzzle in its entirety will become clear, and hopefully, you’ll start with the edges.\nToday, Wednesday, May 20, 2024, I am grateful that:\nGary reached out a bit earlier today. We speak often so an unexpected call is rare. We got a chance to catch up on a few things. He knows my current situation with regards to work and finances and unsolicited he sent me some cash to help. He’s been a constant since we met over thirty years ago and it’s no surprise he’s still doing the same.\nVeronica sent me a huge gift package. Part of my thank you message said it felt like Christmas in May. Coffee, snacks, and six pairs of shorts. I knew the shorts were coming, but the coffee is some of the best I’ve tasted in five years living here. She remembered how much I liked it from her previous trips and decided to send me a kilo.\nI got a chance to drink good coffee again. That coffee from Veronica really helped my routine this morning. Hoping I can land another contract soon so I can drink some before starting my work day.\nCan you see your puzzle?\nIf not, can you see the edges?\nHave you started?\nGet started today.\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "content": "Staying On Track\nYesterday I wrote about the four stages of learning. I only mentioned the first and the last, but the two in the middle are “Conscious Incompetence” and “Conscious Competence.” In my experience, I am quite excited when embarking on a new endeavor. Learning a new skill, starting a new job, reading a new book, or starting a new course, my enthusiasm rises when I get to learn something I didn’t know. I’m totally okay with the fact that I don’t know everything, so unconscious incompetence isn’t a problem. To know that I’m making mistakes is quite troublesome mentally.\nThat's the most challenging part of learning something new for me. Afterwards, to know what to do and put forth the concentration to get it done, I’m good during this stage. In fact, it may very well be my favorite stage of learning. Conscious Competence is this stage. The ability to do what’s needed, but it requires focus and effort. This stage keeps me on track. I’m fully engaged with whatever it is I’m doing. I don’t have to worry about anything outside of what I’m doing. I’ve got on the proverbial blinders, if you will. I’m locked in and getting things done. I’m working with confidence and working competently. \nIn these two middle stages, I’m fully engaged. Taking on something new or stick with something after mastery is when I am most challenged. What I’ve learned is there’s nothing wrong with easy mode. The same things I find “easy” are the things others may and typically do, pay handsomely for. I often forget about the hours I’ve spent to master a particular skill. I usually think about me with the new skill or talent, not before and the time, effort, and energy required to be competent or master the skill. Like a woman birthing her first child, saying she will never do that again, then becoming the mother of four or five more kids. It could be similar to the person with a problem drinker that gets drunk, gets arrested, then says they’ll never drink again, only to get drunk again. \nTime may indeed heal wounds, but it also muddies the water of my memory. I don’t recall sufficiently the pains of learning something new. Therefore, when solving problems for others, I basically give away my skills. Not because others don’t value them, but because I don’t. I value  them how I am, not how I was before having them. This came out in a conversation with a good friend yesterday. We were speaking of our deficiencies and this was one of my many areas which needs improvement. \nMoving forward, I’ll work on turning my liabilities into assets. I’ll be cognizant that staying on track is the only way to fulfill my purpose and my reason for being. \nToday, Wednesday, April 17, 2024, I am grateful that: \nMy helper, Jovy, didn’t arrive until much later this morning. The interruption of my writing and morning routine tends to affect the rest of my day. She still arrived earlier than expected, but it was acceptable. \nI’m making some progress on my projects. I will need to devote more time to getting things completing, but slow progress is better than no progress at all. \nMy right hand isn’t hurting as much as it was yesterday. The pain yesterday was disruptive. Not so much today, but still uncomfortable. I’m hoping the new sensations I’m feeling means it’s healing, but not totally certain.\nDaniel and I got a chance to talk and catch up. It’s interesting that every conversation I get a takeaway for growth. I’m hoping he can say the same and I’ll work on making sure that’s the case.\nWhich stage of learning do you enjoy most?\nAre there stages you prefer more than others?\nWhich skills have you mastered? List all of your skills in Stage Four.\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

If you haven’t heard that old question, but you’ve been reading my lists for a bit, you’ll recall my grocery store analogy. If none of those sound familiar, I’ll explain once more for those newer to my audience.\nImagine sitting at home, then realizing you eed to grab a head of lettuce for your dinner salad. You grab your car keys, drive to the store, walk right over and grab a head of nice lettuce. You look around, but choose to purchase just what you need, do so, then head back home. Simple and straightforward enough, right?\nNow imagine the same scenario, but this time when you grab you keys, your phone rings. A friend is asking if you’d like to grab a cup of coffee. When you arrive at the store’s parking lot, a former coworker sees you and wants to talk. While you’re in the store you run into a neighbor pickup up a few things. An hour or so later you finally make it back home only to realize you didn’t buy your lettuce. Exhausted from the excursion, you decide you can skip your salad tonight and grab the lettuce on the way home from work tomorrow.\nTwo similar scenarios, but quite different outcomes. The second situation was riddled with distractions. The first person stayed the course. The second person didn’t get what they set out to get even though they had a clear objective when they began. The first person had tunnel vision so to speak, did what they set out to get done, and enjoyed a nice salad at dinner.\nIn life we are faced with a constant barrage of distractions. Arriving a bit early for work, staying a bit later, long lunches, soccer or football practices for the kids, dinner dates with the spouse, weekend excursions, and I could increase the list ad infinitum. It all appears worthwhile in the moment, but these seemingly small distractions can lead you astray. The have to potential to slow your progress, delay your efforts, and deter you from accomplishing your ultimate objective.\nI’m assuming, of course, you have an objective, a mission, a purpose. If you don’t have one, then by all means, do what you like, with whom you like, whenever you like. If, however, you do have purpose, be mindful of distractions. They may be an accelerant, but recall the question to ask when determining if they are. “How will this help me fulfill my purpose?” If the immediate answer is “It won’t” then it’s a distraction. If the answer is along the lines of “I don’t know” then consider investing some time and further investigate the thing. \nToday, Wednesday, June 12, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI got a chance to serve Dale. He was needing some help with a few things and I helped. He helped me as well and I would call that a mutually beneficial exchange. \nEven with my day almost over, I’m finishing my writing for this day. Not much progress in the way of writing, but other areas were completed.\nI got a chance to send over all the video scripts, quizzes, and two sample videos to Herb. He’ll review, offer some changes, and I’ll get that done tomorrow hopefully. Once completed we only need to discuss payment, uploading to his platform and a bit of training. Payment is most important to me at the moment, with making sure his needs and expectations are met. I’ll do my part and he will do his as always.\nI’m almost at the point where I can officially launch his program and mine. It’s a bit challenging the first time around, but after each completed task, I become more proficient, the kinks get worked out, and the learning curve get flattened. This will be an interesting few months to close the year.\nHow do you deal with distractions?\nAre you aware they occur?\nList two ways you could improve in dealing with delays and distractions.\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "content": "Stratas, Echelons, and Leveling Up\nA few moments ago I had a conversation with a new found friend. We live in the same building, his son started culinary school last week, and he’s here making sure his son gets settled into his new routine. I shared with him my delight in being back in the city. After living in the province for nearly a year, moving back to civilization has helped my attitude. \nI shared that for years I’d simply gone with the flow. Worked on being adaptable and the like, not thinking about my standards. I had written about my belief that “it” was supposed to be uncomfortable. I didn’t realize until moving into this new location how much I’d lowered my standards. In this scenario it looks like I’m the slowly cooked frog legs.\nI’m speculating, but if someone had thrown me into my previous situation right after moving to the country, I would have jumped on a plane back to America. I probably would have done the same thing for a couple of the previous years. But my decline was slow and gradual. I didn’t even notice to be honest. If the living conditions were similar to the states, I would have gone from upper middle class to lower middle class to the ghetto. This move puts me a bit better than where I was but not quite in the elite or wealthy neighborhoods. I’m a couple blocks away, probably sharing the same zip code, but not exactly where I’d like to dwell.\nThe friend of mine said, it’s about leveling up. I agreed. Set your standard then work to maintain and then upgrade. It’s sad to admit that I’d forgotten that part. I’d become a bit complacent and only having been thrust back into an environ that more to what I’m accustomed to do I finally realize how true those words are.\nI’m not sure where others set their standards. I’m not sure if others actually have a standard. All I am sure of is that I must set then upgrade mine. If you’ve been living like I just discussed and think it’s time to upgrade, you can do so. If you haven’t even set a standard, you can do that as well. You can establish the strata or level you will adhere to and strive towards the next echelon. You are powerful beyond measure and anything you can envision happening can and will, if you put forth the effort in a particular manner.\nToday, Tuesday, July 2, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI’m becoming more aware. My perspective, my situation, my present and future status are becoming acutely top of mind. I’ve usually avoided planning and putting things on paper, but today I do that more than ever before. \nI’m making progress, but it’s slow for unpacking. I’ll keep getting things put away and get acclimated, but this area is one of my deficiencies. I’m struggling without having a helper to get me settled in.\nI spoke with an attorney yesterday about my current situation . She offered some insights and is moving forward with starting an investigation into my situation and the procedure that was followed or not followed. Either way, it’s great to take some action and get some traction on this front.\nHave you set a standard?\nHave you compromised your standards in any area?\nIf so, would you do so again? \nWhat are you willing to do to elevate your echelon?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "Superlative or Bust",
        "content": "Superlative or Bust\n“Close enough for government work” or “close enough for hand grenades” and a few other sayings come to mind as I think of getting close. Close is good, but it’s not great. Close is the average person’s way of saying they succeeded. Close is not hitting the mark. Close is approaching the mark, having it in sight, then settling for something else or worse still, telling yourself it’s good enough. I’ve done that very thing. I’ve told myself being average or mediocre was acceptable. It’s not and it’s never been when I know being average is not my best.\nSuperlative is derived from the Latin meaning extravagant or exaggerated. Something, maybe someone like yourself or myself, being described as extravagant, isn’t necessarily bad. Imagine your clients, your peers, your leadership team or managers speaking of you and your work in the superlative. Imagine the amount of accolades, awards, bonuses, salary increases, and other incentives you’d benefit from if your work, your end product or service offering was extravagant. What you offered and delivered was so far beyond your coworkers or competitors that the cost of your service or product or the time it took for you to deliver it was not an issue. \nI believe, and I could be wrong, we live in a time of mediocrity. Being in the middle, being average, doing something that’s good enough, or close enough for government has become acceptable. As a society we’ve grown accustomed to and tolerant of substandard. I also believe that’s the reason that individuals that deliver something extravagant are heralded with all sorts or praise. In business, in athletics, in life, those that develop themselves, their skill sets and set themselves apart are the ones we tend to look up to. We tend to put them on a pedestal or edify them and their work, when it’s quite possible that on an individual basis we could achieve something similar with regards to superlatives. \nI’m a couple of days behind my self imposed deadlines. I’m a bit frustrated. I’m desperately wanting to deliver an offering. But, I refuse to settle. I will not offer something average or inadequate. I will not launch and build my brand and organization with an offering that someone else can simply copy and compete with. I will not deliver without my offering being superlative. It’s not acceptable and I will not allow myself and my company to do so. If a deadline is missed, if a budget is broken, or some other standard is not met, all will be forgiven when an extravagant offering is placed in the client's possession. \nDo not settle for mediocrity. Do not accept average. Do your absolute best, your very very best, each and every single time you begin and end something. It will be frustrating in the beginning. It will beg your innermost self to accept mediocrity. But know and believe, you can and will deliver the very best of what’s available in your market, your industry, your company, or your team. Others will take a bit of time to see it and acknowledge it, but you will know when you look in the mirror at night that you can lay your head on your pillow and rest well having delivered something superlative. \nToday, Tuesday, July 9, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI’m willing to do my best. Not what others may think my best is, but what I know deep down in the depths of my being are. Internal truth is greater than external validation. \nI’m aware of what corrections I need to make on my project. It didn’t take too long and today will be great for productivity. I’m hoping to get all eleven videos completed.\nBorrowing the expertise of others isn’t as challenging as it once was. A couple weeks ago one of the locals in my new place offered a suggestion. From his suggestion action is being taken on the recuperation of my expenses from the accident. It hasn’t been two weeks since he said something and the ball is moving and moving fast. We’ll see how this develops.\nDo you deliver superlatives?\nIs your end deliverable extravagant?\nIf not, will you begin doing so today and moving forward?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "Take It To The Max",
        "content": "Take It To The Max\nFor well over a year, I’ve been working on a freelancer platform. It’s basically a marketplace for independent contractors, so there are some benefits for the employer and the employee. Last night a couple of thoughts popped to mind. First, I’ve got one contract at the lowest rate I’ve worked for in over a year on the platform. Second, the hours of the contract are less than any contract I’ve had since joining the platform. Third, and probably most important, I haven’t maxed out the contract so far this week. \nIn a bit over a year, I had at least a dozen contracts. Every contract ranged between 20 and 30 hours per week. At one point this summer, I had a perfect storm, three contracts, three different time zones, totaling sixty hours per week. In every instance, whether one contract or multiples, I haven’t maxed out any in total weekly hours. \nMy lesson is this - “If you can’t take advantage and maximize what I give you, what makes you think I would give you more?” That’s the question I imagine my Creator asking me or anyone else unwilling to or unable to max out what’s clearly in front of them. Same lesson applies in many areas. If I can’t be a great steward of five dollars, what evidence have I shown my Creator I can be a great steward of five thousand, five million, or five billion? There’s no evidence of my ability to handle those things. If I’m unable to handle the small things, how does that show someone, like an employer, that I’m capable of handling larger tasks. \nAt some point, I forgot that the devil is in the details. Small things matter big time. I’m guessing and I’d have to contemplate or maybe read some lists from last year to see if I was getting close to maxing out my contracts.That’s the lesson though, treat every deal as if it’s my last. Additionally, max out every possibility. The more I max out, the more that will come. My ability to manage small things, small wages, small contracts - the miniscule, seemingly insignificant things are what matter. \nToday, Wednesday, January 24, 2024, I am grateful that:\nDiana and I spoke a bit earlier. She’s got everything covered and there’s not much I can do to be of service at this point. Some items mays pop up later in the week, but today she’s good.\nThe lessons continue to be revealed. A second lesson in as many days. Confirmation that I need to continue to write consistently. The practice of disciplined creativity comes to mind again.\nI’ve got work now. A small contract is better than no contract. For me today, this small contract keeps me afloat. It doesn’t allow me to get ahead, but I won’t fall behind either. \nHow do you max it out?\nAre you consistently maximizing your opportunities?\nHave you noticed when you max out your opportunities, more appear?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "The Discipline of Writing",
        "content": "The Discipline of Writing\nYears ago when I met my current Writing Mentor Herb, one of the things he suggested was to write something everyday. He further explained it didn’t matter if I wrote a paragraph, a page, or a chapter. He basically said I needed to get better by doing what I said I was doing, writing. \nYears before, when I was a new Financial Advisor, one of the tenured advisors told all the new people to write a ticket everyday. In essence, perform a securities transaction daily. It didn’t matter whether I was buying or selling a stock, an option, or bonds, but that we needed write an order ticket everyday.A former fellow coworker and salesman says and does the same thing with cars. “Hermano, if I’m not selling a car everyday, I have to ask myself why I came to work. It’s why I’m here, to sell cars and if I’m not selling one, then why I am taking time away from my family?” Each of them and many more exhibit self discipline. \nDefined as the practice of training people to obey rules or a code of behavior, using punishment to correct disobedience, each of the three mentioned earlier displayed exceptional amounts of discipline. I on the other hand, faced the punishment side of the definition. Without self discipline, I was punished with failure or mediocrity as a Financial Advisor and Car Salesman. The definition holds true that if you don’t do one, follow a code of behavior, you get punished. \nOne of the benefits or by-products of living with purpose is self discipline. I have vast experience of living without it, but only scattered amounts of living with it. Sustained self discipline has proven elusive, until recently. Over the last seven or eight years, I’ve done a few things consistently and I’ve begun to reap the benefits. The discipline of writing goes beyond writing and cn be applied to every other career I’ve had and probably every other aspect of my life. \nIgnorance is not a viable option. The practice of training people to obey rules or a code of behavior says what need to happen on my end. If I don’t know the rules or the code of behavior, I must first learn those. Once I’ve committed those to memory, then I must follow that code or set of rules. It’s simple and straightforward, but not easy as it sounds \nToady, Monday, April 28, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI feel more renewed after the weekend. I was able to gather my thoughts, get a bit of clarity, and develop a tentative plan of action. I say tentative since plans change as life happens. The destination remains unchanged though.\nI completed a first draft of an outline. I’ve got several more books in me and I’ve begun the process of writing my next one. It’ll combine my experiences with the values and principles I live by. It’ll basically lay out how I’ve been able to do what I’ve done nd what I’m doing. \nVision is returning. I’m able to see my destination and how I’ll get there. It may vary a bit since I’m going some place I’ve never been and my mind fills in the blanks with similar instances, but the vision is there. I hadn;t had this type of clarity and vision in quite a while and it’s a sig my recovery is progressing nicely.\nWhat are one or two core duties of your current career?\nDo you perform that thing everyday?

Those small accomplishments along the way to your ultimate destination. I did that yesterday with dinner and to my surprise, it took too long and offset my evening schedule. The party is over and that’s the last time I’ll do that. The time spent eating dinner out and about could have been invested better and wiser.\nI’ve written about enjoying my new place and meeting more like minded individuals. Dinner was with one of my new neighbors and although it was great food and fellowship, it wasn’t the best use of my time. I can not do things that distract me from my purpose. I can not put time into those things that keep me away from my reason for living in another country to begin with. I must stand guard over my vision, my purpose. \nOthers may enjoy my time, but I’ve only got the same amount as everyone else. I’ve squandered too much time and it’s not acceptable. It was okay when I wasn’t aware. Now that I’m awake, those things I did while unaware or sleep, are no longer aligned with me and my mission. The party is over, for now.\nThere are times when quiet is needed. There are times when isolation is needed. There are times when cutting off everything and everyone is what’s required. I’m not sure if the time you or I require will be a few days, a few weeks, or a few months. What I am certain of is delaying and avoiding these periods of isolation and intensity and detrimental to growth. \nDuring my previous periods similar to these my relationship with my Creator has grown. During previous periods I learned more about myself. During previous periods I’ve emerged with more accomplished and higher esteem for my abilities and myself. \nInvest in you. The return on your investment is infinite. You will receive greater returns than any stock, bond, or crypto market in existence. Your investment will eclipse the most significant real estate or business portfolio. Your investments in these times, when it seems pointless and not worth it, yield the highest dividends to ever exist. Invest now, party later.\nToday, Thursday, July 18, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI can see both sides of a coin. Acknowledgement and recognition are great, but too much celebrating isn’t beneficial.\nI’m willing to ask for and receive assistance. It’s occurred so many times over the years, taking it for granted can and does happen. The simple fact is this, I serve a Creator that is willing and able to assist on my mission. After all, the mission was commissioned by Him.\nI’ve got more clarity now than in the past six or eight months. I’ve begun the work and working to implement systems to eliminate potential pitfalls. My goal is to get the systems launched in the next week or so.

        "content": "The Revenant\nThe movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio is about a guy left for dead and who probably should have died. All of the party he traveled with assumed he died, but he did not. Without giving away the entire plot, I’d suggest setting aside a bit of time and watching the movie. We can learn a few lessons from the movie.\nThe first lesson I can relate to is don’t give up. No matter the situation, no matter how dire the circumstances, do not quit. Next, ignore the naysayers. In fact, you may find yourself surrounded by individuals who believe quitting would be best. My suggestion and my personal experience is to get away from those people at all cost. Third lesson is just because you decide to keep going and to not quit, your journey isn’t guaranteed to be obstacle free. You and I making a decision to keep going and move with conviction doesn’t mean the world will conspire to make it easy.\nAgain, for those of you that haven’t seen the movie, I won’t write any spoilers. In my life and quite recently, some thought I would die. Others, in more distant times, have thought I should quit. A couple have asked why I haven’t quit. Some have thought me to be crazy. I may be that and more, but at least I’m not a quitter. There have been times recently and in my history that I’ve quit. I have succumbed to comfort. I didn’t want to put in the work. I have been lazy. I chose the easier, softer, more comfortable path. My reward was miserable, including multiple hospitalizations for suicide prevention, multiple medications daily, group therapy, and individual counseling sessions. The feelings of hopelessness, despair, eventually regret and remorse of missed opportunities are not missed. In fact, I rarely think of that old version of myself. It will be the same with you and all who choose to not quit, to not surrender, and prove all thinking you were dead are supposed to be dead wrong!\nDo not quit! Distance yourself from the doubters, the naysayers. Choose your course and get moving immediately!\nToday, Tuesday, April 2, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI’m back to writing. After two months I can truly say I’ve missed writing. At times it’s seemed as if it was a chore. Other times, like today, it’s a pleasure. It’s essential. It’s part of who I am, my very being.\nI’m healing. The accident has set me behind on my progress for the first quarter. Fortunately for me, I’ve got another nine months to get things accomplished this year.\nThe advancements of others will accelerate my progress. There are so many technology advancements in other areas that I’ll be able to adapt to help accomplish my purpose. I’m guessing when we will all work towards our purpose, everyone benefits.\nI’ve been able to remove myself from the naysayers. They still appear periodically, but I’m more aware of their behavior and their affect on me, so I quickly stop associating with them and those around them.\nThe death of your old self may be needed. Those things that were once acceptable will no longer be tolerated. The course you choose will be wrought with challenges, but such is life. \nWe, you and I, have no idea how many people are watching us. I am ignorant to the number of lives my victories will impact in a positive manner. Do not quit. Do not yield. \nKeep going, no matter what happens. \nThe other side of what you’re going through is where your reward lies.\nBe Greater,\nAbe"

        "content": "Thinking and Talking Won’t Get It Done\nIdeas are great. I’ve had a ton of them. So many I can’t remember, especially when it comes to business and making money. I can see opportunities just about everywhere. That’s the thinking part of it. To validate my idea, I’ll tell you and others about it. You’ll either play Devil’s advocate and tell me how it won’t work or you’ll be impressed, excited, and encouraging, telling me I should really do that particular thing. That’s the talking part of it. For decades now, I’ve had so many of those great ideas. I’m not financially independent, rich, or remotely close to being wealthy. I know from personal experiences that thinking and talking won’t get it done. It requires more. It requires focused, consistent, and sustained action and assessment. When changes are needed, they must be implemented swiftly.\nI’ve failed on both fronts many times. I’ve failed to make changes and I’ve failed to make them swiftly. There are four stages to learning and one of those stages in “Unconscious Competence.” A simple way to explain it is doing whatever the task are on autopilot. You don’t have to think about them, they don’t require much effort for you to complete. You’ve done them so many times, it’s basically effortless. My history includes a bunch of me not being at that stage. My development during those times would be better described as the first stage, “Unconscious Incompetence.” Basically, you don’t know what you don’t know. I didn’t know I needed to assess my current situation, at the time, and when I finally learned to assess, I didn’t know how or what changes to make.\n“Experience is the best teacher” is an adage we’ve all probably heard. What I’ve learned over the years is “It doesn’t have to be my experience!” Life is too short for me to use the trial and error method for all my ideas. Had I done then what I’m doing now, I would have been much further along my path. But that’s water under the bridge and I’m going to cry over spilled milk since it’s part of my journey. Since this list is as much for you the reader as it is for me the writer, I made reminder notes. I’ll write later about the other two stages of learning and also about the importance of leveraging the experience of others to accelerate your journey. Today though, I’m finished since my right wrist is throbbing and I’m starting to think that I’m not as recovered as I thought I was.\nToday, Tuesday, April 16, 2024, I am grateful that:\nAs more people find out I need assistance, they step up. I’m not Mother Teresa or anything close, but I’m sure my efforts have aided others. What goes around comes around, and I’m so happy the boomerang I sent out is returning. I know now, sending bigger and better boomerangs more often is part of what I need to do.\nMy wrist is feeling better. I actually stopped writing a couple of hours ago because it hurt so much to type. The pain subsided and I’m back at it. This is important and once small sense of accomplishment is writing and finishing this list five days a week.\nI am writing to my audience. Before, it was about me and fighting depression. Then it morphed into discipline and consistency. Next, writing was about quiet time with my Creator. Today and who knows how much longer, this is about writing to an audience. People on a similar path, but possibly in a different place than I. My experiences may assist. I may be able to make a positive impact.\nVeronica and I got to chat a bit earlier. She’s settling in on her new job and reached out this morning to check and make sure I was doing ok. Happy we’re cordial to each other. \nAre you willing to learn from someone else’s experience?\nWhat skills have you developed into the unconscious competence stage?\nHow much time do you devote each week to monetizing those skills?\nHow would your life and the life of those you care about change if you monetized those skills?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

Not entirely sure how, but it is. \nI’ve got too many things to get finished and it’s been that way for months. I’ve made lists, but haven’t finished every item. I’ve finished some and had to wait for various reasons. Now I’ve got a few days, maybe two for uninterrupted work and I’ll take advantage.\nThis thing and that thing and the other things all seem important. They all appear to have a high priority. That’s how they seem and it may very well be true, but the truth of the matter is, I’m a bit befuddled and confused on what’s the most important thing. \nIt appears to be money. Had a potential client back out of a deal and not pay. That hurt a bunch. Haven’t landed any freelance gigs, but that’s mostly cause whenever I’m doing that work, I know it’s distracting me from what’s most important. What’s most important is how I’m going to fulfill my purpose. I have a means to do so now and that’s where I’m directing my energy for the most part. Hate to admit it, but I haven’t done enough. There’s more work to finish and the window is closing.\nI’m not going to ramble on and on and how much needs to get done. I’m not going to keep writing. I’m going to do what’s important today. That may change tomorrow, but today it’s clear. Finish one thing. Have something to show for my efforts. I’ll work on the second thing, after the first one is done.\nToday, Wednesday, October 2, 2024, I am grateful that:\nA couple short paragraphs offered clarity. I’m better when I put it in front of me and out of my head. \nI’ve got enough for today. Money is tight. Other resources are as well. Today though, I have all I need to complete the task at hand.\nI’m willing to step up, even if it’s less than I’d like. I will finish a total of two for sure and maybe three videos. Afterwards I’ll have proof of concept for potential investors. That’s all that I’ll need to secure the funding that’ll be needed for the first 50 titles.\nWrite down what needs to be finished.\nPut a number on the highest priority.\nStart and finish item one.\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "Too Big To Fail",
        "content": "Too Big To Fail\nDuring the housing crisis in 2008, the saying of some financial institutions were they were too big to fail. Meaning, the banks had so much of an impact on the U.S. economy that it wouldn’t be wise to let them fail. A bunch of those banks received a bailout package from the government and are still in business. Not sure of more than one that actually went out of business. But that’s for the banks, finance, and the housing market, not me and my endeavors.\nFor what I’m working on “too big to fail” has a slight twist. If you’ve done your market research and know the size of your market, is the market too big for you to fail? If you took 10 percent of the market, then only got 10 percent of that number, then only 10 percent of that number, is that enough for your endeavor to prosper? Let’s say you are in the tea business. A quick search shows there are about 5 billion cups consumed daily. Ten percent of 5 billion is 500 million and ten percent of that number is 50 million with 5 million cups being ten percent of the last number. \nImagine taking 10 pieces of something to make one penny and that’s the number. Not a penny, but 10 pieces to make a penny. That’s a pretty small number which is the entire point. Is your market too big to fail? Are you pursuing a big enough endeavor for your market, your time, your expertise, your resources and the like? With our tea scenario, if we sold 5 million cups of tea daily and made one dollar per cup, that’s a big enough market and potential source of business and revenue. But if we sold luxury homes or yachts or private jets, the market is much smaller and the chances for failure would be significantly higher. \nYesterday I crunched some numbers. I probably should have done this sooner, but I didn’t. My overall market size is estimated between 375 million and 460 million. Ten percent of that is 37 to 46 million and ten percent of that is 3.7 to 4.6 million. If I’m able to capture ten percent of that number annually, I’m at 370,000 to 460,000 units sold. For easy math at one dollar profit per unit the revenue is decent. The profit per unit is different of course, but the concept is the same. Do the math. Do the research. Invest in something so much bigger than you, your chances of success are great. \nToday, Friday, July 26, 2024, I am grateful that:\nArithmetic is all that’s needed. Basic multiplication and division are all that I needed to run the numbers. It’s not super sophisticated or complicated. It’s not being overly optimistic, but rather quite pessimistic. The numbers still work and the confirmation to continue is provided.\nI got to meet and dine with a guy visiting from Alabama. Funny thing is we both spent years in the same industry. It was great to reminisce about the industry, failures and successes and the walk down memory lane was refreshing. I miss the industry and may revisit, but no time in the future. \nMoe, Jessa, and Owen stopped by for a bit. It was different hosting and having people in my place. That’s something rather uncomfortable for me as I’m an isolationist, but I was happy for the company. Being slightly uncomfortable is okay as well, since growth typically accompanies or follows periods of discomfort.\nHave you crunched your numbers?\nHow big is your market?\nIs it too big to fail?\nIf you haven’t done your research, do so now.\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "content": "Turning Points\nIn Alien versus Predator starring Sanaa Latham, there’s a scene when they’re riding in a helicopter and the pilot says, “We just passed the PSR.” One of the passengers is disappointed at missing it and Latham’s character explains it wasn’t a tourist sight, but rather the “point of safe return.” The phrase refers to a place during the flight when the aircraft can no longer return safely to its departure airport. It will need to continue to its destination airport or divert to another location. \nWe’ve all probably seen a picture of a car or person at a fork in the road. At some point in their journey this person had to make a decision on which route to travel. I’d read, “We stood at a turning point” years ago and thought about the fork in the road. This turning point literally means we stop moving in one direction and begin moving in another. But before we can start moving in that new direction, we have to decide. We have “to cut off” moving in the previous or current direction because we’re at the “turning point.”\n“We stood at the turning point…” comes from another book I’ve read. “...We asked His protection and care, with complete abandon.” The capital “H” is referencing a Creator or God, but the sentiment of complete abandon resonates this morning. Faced with a big decision, a turning point, best to ask for our Creator’s help than going it alone. Better to believe in something and be wrong, than not to believe and be right. I believe. \nNow I’m at this turning point and I’ve decided to ask, with complete abandon, for my Creator’s help. Not to proselytize, believe what you like, but for me today, I believe in a Creator of all. As such, I’ve decided to abandon or give up completely and ask for my Creator’s protection and care. If He created me, as I believe, He’d be akin to a Father. I haven’t met a parent, Mom or Dad, that doesn’t want the absolute best for their children. So, if I’m willing to surrender to my parent’s care and protection, meaning to shield or defend from harm or injury, there’s no better solution. \nIt’s taken longer to write this than normal. I’ve become more adept at defining words and their origins and there’s been a bunch of that this morning. This is something I’ve rarely done and at this stage of my journey, I’ve never done it. I’m needing clarity and precision. I’m at my turning point and just passed my point of safe return. I must be exact. \nIf you’ve arrived or if you’re approaching your turning point or point of safe return, what’s your plan? How will you handle the situation? Are you going to divert to an alternate location? Will you ask your Creator for protection and care? Will you be specific?\nToday, Friday, August 30, 2024, I am grateful that:\nHerb and I had our weekly conversation. We covered a few things and as always, I believe I gained more than I gave. Not sure how to remedy this and it’s been happening since we’ve been speaking. Some people are abundant resources of wisdom and Herb is one of those people. \nI’ve got more clarity on how to proceed. I believe, nope, I’m convinced of my direction. Now is the time to implement, move forward with resolve, and invite others to participate in the journey. Some will choose not to, others will join and either way, I’ll continue without regret knowing an invitation was extended.\nI’ve been able to make a decision. It’s not something I take lightly, surrendering control, but it is something that’s needed. More can be done, in a better way, and surrendering control is the best solution."

        "title": "Warmup Then Perform",
        "content": "Warmup Then Perform\nAs I think about professionals, most warm up before they perform. From professional golfers or basketball players to concert pianist or opera singers. All eyes globally are upon Paris and the Summer Olympics. Each time I watch an event, the athletes warm then perform. I’ve yet to ever see someone performing on a professional level go straight to their task. Not in soccer, not in baseball, not once have I seen this happen. Yet, for some peculiar reason, I think it’s possible for me. \nI’ve repeatedly performed without warming up. I’ve picked up the phone for sales calls, given presentations, or offered in person or virtual consultations without warming up. As I was thinking about this while writing, the thought occurred that I’m not performing professionally. Nothing I’ve done in my career has been broadcast on television, recorded and edited for publication on the radio or in print. Not one single thing. This may be the case for most professionals in the respective careers. The athletes and performers I mentioned earlier are in the top percentile of everyone doing that particular thing. \nFunny thing is I used to warm up. Funny thing is I used to practice. Funny thing is I committed my presentation and with some positions my script to memory. It’s really not funny as I continue. It’s sad to think I may have grown complacent. It’s sad to think I may be neglecting my client by not properly preparing. It’s sad to think nothing I’m doing may be broadcast to the masses because I’m performing at an elite level. \nI believe we are capable of much more than we deliver. I believe we, this includes myself, underperform in most instances. I believe and I’m becoming more convinced we become accustomed to mediocrity. Constant reinforcement and affirmations from family, friends, coworkers, and the list goes on to establish, re-establish and set mediocrity in place, entrenched and engrained in our minds and actions. Those elite performers surround themselves with coaches and mentors and push beyond standards of mediocrity or being average. \nDuring a consult last night, I found myself repeating things my mentor and a few others have said to me over the years. I found myself recalling and reciting some of the lessons I’d learned over the years. I also found myself thinking and knowing the client and I suffer from several similarities. I didn’t mind losing control of the call, but I did find myself thinking that I needed to improve this particular skill. I found myself needing to improve my ability to ask more effective closed end questions. I found myself thinking this is all great info, but it’s not what I asked for. I also thought last night and this morning that me and my clients would be better served if I were better at my job. I didn’t warm up before performing and although my performance wasn’t embarrassing, it was not noteworthy, in my opinion. There are ways to improve and warming up and practicing is one of the ways to do so. Taking an accurate and honest appraisal of performances is another way to improve. \nI’ll make changes, warm up with practice, and any other items needed to perform at an elite level. If I’m going to do it, I may as well be one of the best to ever do it. If I’m not considered one of the best by my peers and those in the industry, I need to at least know I did my absolute best.\nToday, Tuesday, August 7, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI’ve got work. It’s been months since I was able to work and a bit longer to actually find work. Now that I have both, I’m finding it a bit challenging to actually do the work. That’s just a matter of adjusting my schedule and exercising some discipline.\nI’m settled into my new place. I actually enjoy living here and most of the people I’ve met. It’ll be less challenging to put forth the effort to earn enough to live here since this is something I want at this moment. \nMy appointments with the acupuncturist are yielding results. Not leaps and bounds by any stretch of imagination. I can say that I’m better after two sessions. There’s continued hope for improvement and it’ll be interesting to see my progress after a few more sessions. \nHow do you warmup?\nIf you don’t, what can you do as a warmup?\nWrite those down.\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

It’s all from decisions I’ve made and I can accept responsibility for my actions, recent and past, but this week it hurts more than normal.\nI didn’t realize until yesterday how much time I’d wasted. I’ve made some purchases and spent so much time looking for the software receipts compared to using the software. My old laptop died and I haven’t been able to access the software, plus I hadn’t used it in months so it was frustrating to say the least. The silver lining is I found two suitable alternatives and I’ll be able to get the same things done this weekend. \nAnother thing about this week is the recognition of a timeline. When working for myself, tracking my progress was laxed to say it nicely. On a job, different story, but with me as my boss, quite laxed. After my accident though, I feel as if I’m on borrowed time. I have a sense of urgency I don’t typically have. It’s different. My history doesn’t include this feeling and it’s a bit unsettling. It’s uncomfortable and Im totally okay with the feeling, it’s just new.\nI’ve also been irritable over the last few weeks. Again, not something that’s normal, but it’s been happening. I don’t want to sit back and say that people are out to get me, but small things are bothering me like they would not have before. All these little things are adding up. I’m not about to explode, but I’m aware things are slightly more important. I’m cool with some of the post accident changes and others will take some getting used to.\nToday, Friday, April 19, 2024, I am grateful that:\nHerb and I had our weekly conversation. He gave me some input on a couple of employee management concerns. He also provided some input about my upcoming community. It’s great to have such an invaluable resource in him. \nSome friends from back home have reached out to check on my progress. Not life long friends, but most of these relationships are over twenty years old. I consider myself fortunate to have people I’m still communicating with that have known me for so long. \nThere’s a little light at the end of the tunnel. My research this week gives me hope for work today and this weekend. I should be able to make some progress and move things forward in swift order. \nWhat’s something you could have done better this week?\nHow can you change that for next week?\nWhat did you do well this week?\nHow can you keep that momentum going?\nAbe, \nBe Greater!!!"

Not to be too overly dramatic, but we may be at war as well. A war for our attention. A war for our focus. A war to keep us distracted from those things most important. \nThe dark days can come quickly and last lengths you may feel unequipped to withstand. Yet, the truth of the matter is, you are equipped. You are capable. You are made of splendid greatness unbeknownst to others, and sometimes from yourself. You are equipped with a light bright enough to push away the darkness. You can produce a radiance great enough to provide light for yourself and others. You merely have to make a decision. \nDark days will come, it’s part of our journey. Times will be tough, difficult, or uncomfortable. The first two terms are relative, but uncomfortable is something we can all relate to. The times when getting out of bed is uncomfortable. The times when getting dressed or taking a shower is uncomfortable. The times when the commute to work or actual speaking to people is comfortable. The times when walking in your front door to be greeted by a spouse, a child, or a loving pet is uncomfortable. \nThose dark days will come, if they haven’t already. Those dark days will yield to the brightest of days too. When the vibrance and radiance of life, your smile, your aura is blinding to others. The key is to outlast the darkness. To hold on with all the fevor you can muster. To stay the course, no matter what may come. \nIt’s in these dark days, like the ones I’m experiencing today and for several months now, I hold true my course. To my purpose, my mission, my reason for being is what I recall. I frequently recall my triumphs. Great and small victories come to mind. The ability to recall, to remember how much I have been blessed with His grace. His kindness sustains and nourishes my resolve. Keeping me steadfast and willing to persist through the darkest of days. \n“Tough times won’t last forever, but tough people do.” Remember, you are splendidly built. You are truly one of one. Throughout eternity there will never be another you and you are capable and competent and able to outlast any darkness you currently face.\nToday, Thursday, May 30, 2024, I am grateful that:"

When this happens and things don’t go as planned, we are faced with a decision. We can stop or keep going. If you stop, which I’ve done on numerous occasions, your resilience muscles remain puny. If you keep going, those same muscles stretch and grow. \nWhen you keep going, you show your capacity to withstand or to recover quickly from difficulties. You display a toughness most people do not. You and I both made a decision to do whatever the thing was. We cut off every other options by deciding and our toughness grows as we push forward. Some do not bounce back. Some are easily discouraged. Some believe the world is out to get them. Some find reasons, better yet, excuses to stop. Others, like you and I, find reasons to keep going. \nAnother benefit I’ve discovered is increased self esteem. I hold myself in higher regard. Not to the point that I’m walking around telling others how great I am, but more of the little quiet thoughts to myself. “You did it before when…” or “This ain’t nothing, remember when…” or any other prompt that pops into mind. These prompts remind me that I’ve accomplished things prior to my current setback. These prompts remind me that I am resilient. These prompts remind me that this particular thing is temporary and I will push forward this time, just like I’ve done before. \nIf you haven’t pushed forward before, well you can’t lean on those types of prompts. If you haven’t failed before, you have no reason or a very small ability to bounce back. You have won and without facing defeat there’s no way to bounce back. But, if you happened upon this after a defeat and you want to know your next step, I’ll happily share. “Keep going!!!”\nOn the other side of the wall you just ran into you’ll find what you’re searching for. You may not know that what you’ve found was what you actually needed and wanted, but you will have found it nonetheless. You are stronger than you know. You are smarter than you know. You can accomplish more than you currently believe. All of those things are on the other side of your current obstacle. Keep going. For clarity, going doesn’t necessarily mean going straight. It could mean stepping to the side, it could mean climbing the wall, it could mean getting a step stool or a ladder or trampoline. All metaphorical or course, but I do mean this literally - keep going. Do not stop at the wall.\nToday, Wednesday, August 14, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI have failed enough to build my resilience muscle.

It’s late afternoon and I’m just now writing as compared to when I first awaken. Typically, writing this is part of my morning routine, yet today no thoughts came to mind. It happens occasionally and some days I won’t write, other time, like today, I write a bit later than normal. \nI put the word feel in quotes for a couple of reasons. The most important is the word itself. “Feelings changes. Facts do not.” Tomorrow, next week, next month, or a decade from now, I won’t recall what I felt like today. What will remain of this day is what I did, now how I felt. I’ve written more than once about “FYF.” I may need to write about it again, but not today. Today is a day to deliver another message. When you’ve got nothing, recall the one time that…\nWe’ve all got a time when we felt as if we had nothing left. When we felt totally drained, exhausted, and were ready to give up. I’ve felt that way so many times it’s almost comedic. But there’s a time for us all, when we were at the end, but had one last thing to get done. And we did that thing. \nThe one last thing is what’s most important. The audacity to keep going when your mind and body tell you to stop. The unrelenting confidence when we think of those times. For you it may only be once. Do you remember that one time? When you’ve got nothing left in the tank, remember that time. Think about how you stood. Think about what you did. Recall the time of year, the weather, the time of day. If you’ve taken the mini excursion just now, how are you feeling? How are you sitting? How are you breathing? It’s different, right? Your body remembers, even when your mind doesn’t. \nYou’ve got more than you believe. I’m the same way. I forget about the great challenges I’ve overcome. I forget about proving the naysayers wrong in many instances. It doesn’t matter if you’ve got one instance, use it. Build on it. Recalling the one time will get you through to the next time or this current time. If this is your first time, know this - this instance is temporary. It may “feel” like it won’t end, but that’s not true. It will end. It hasn’t ALWAYS been this way and it will NOT always be this way. This is temporary and you…you are strong enough, bold enough, courageous enough to outlast this situation. You’ve got more than enough to make it through this. You are more than capable! This is only a slight hiccup. It may slow you down a bit, but it won’t stop you or your journey.\nToday, Thursday, January 25, 2024, I am grateful that: \nI’m fully rested. I’ve been without a contract since the middle of December, but I chose to keep my work schedule. This allowed a rather seamless transition when I won another contract. So rest, although quite basic, is something that tops my list today.\nI’ve got a call scheduled with Blanco a bit later. Hoping we can solve a problem for him. It’ll give me a chance to serve and him a chance to move closer to his goals as well. \nI’m making progress on the hosting account. Nameservers setup and should be finished propagating today.

        "content": "Whom Do You Serve\nPeople help along the way. The question really is who do you help? How are you serving those around you? How will you use those talents you possess to make your community better?\nYou’ve figured out what you want and why you want it, now it’s time to figure out who’ll benefit from what you do. It’s a straightforward approach to this phase of your development. If you’re like me, you think about yourself first. For me, I’m my favorite subject. Being of service was something I didn’t think about often in my youth. Fortunately, I’ve experienced some lifestyle changes and as a result, I’ve been able to live with an adjusted outlook on life.\nIf you’re focused primarily on yourself, it’s not a bad thing, but it may not be the best use of your talents. You are probably neglecting the world of those talents. Your selfishness is depriving others. So, whom do you serve? How can you serve them? It’s worth mentioning repeatedly. \nWhen I approach life in this manner, focusing outward, I can observe things I’m able to change. I can see how to put my talents to work, not for me but for others. That’s the goal, to be of service. You may not believe that way and that’s fine, stop reading this. If you keep reading, I’m guessing you think I could be right and I just may be correct.\nQuiet times of reflections will be needed. If you’re constantly focusing outward and not looking at yourself, lots can get missed. But, the benefits of my efforts are invested in helping and serving others. By no means am I some sort of saint or philanthropist. I’m not walking around handing out food and money to random people. First because I don’t have it and second because that wouldn’t be the best use of my talents.\nToday it’s called an avatar. In sales we call it an ideal client. In writing, it’s your audience. Here’s a few questions I’ve asked myself about those I serve. You can feel free to borrow them as I have and use them freely. \nWhat are their age ranges?\nWhat’s their education?\nWhere do they live?\nHow much money do they make?\nWhat are they interested in, meaning their hobbies and whatnot?\nWhat keeps them awake at night, meaning their problems?\nWhat problems do they have?\nWhere do they work?\nWhat are their professions?\nAfter you’ve thought about them, take some time to ask yourself:\nHow can my talents serve these people?\nWhat can I do to be of service today and a decade from now?\nSet those things on paper. Write them down and carry it around with you. You can also make it the wallpaper on your cell phone. The thing is you want to keep those things top of mind. It’ll help focus outward about the people you serve and not inward about the challenge you may face. It helps me in that way and I’m certain you’ll get the same benefits I have. If I knew another way that’s what I’d be writing about, but this is what I know. This is what’s worked. It’s not a theory or something I read in a book. It’s my experience. Give it a shot. It’s worked for me and it’ll work for you too. \nToday, Wednesday, August 28. 2024, I am grateful that:\nI’m willing to serve. It’s not always easy or fulfilling. Some days, not all but some, are more challenging than others. I have to remember it’s the reason I exist and my mastery and use of my gifts are the greatest display of gratitude to my Creator.\nEven when it’s not going as expected, it’s going. I’ve had a couple of setbacks, as we all have, but all in all, life is good. I’ve been worse off than I currently am. I’ve also been better. Each has its benefits and challenges.\nI’m getting some things done on my company. I’m further away from launching than I’d planned, but I still have a few more days. Time to dig in, lose sleep, and get it done.\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

This accident has left me partially disabled and while I am recovering, normalcy is still aloof. My savings are depleted and I’m in debt. I’ve recently moved and as a result, the little money I had remaining is gone. \nIn the movie, without spoiling it for those who haven’t seen it, two of the main characters are in a situation and require assistance. One of the characters calls his boss and the boss keeps asking questions. The character in distress gets upset and basically says I don’t wanna hear about this and that and the other thing. I want to hear that the calvary is on the way. The boss replies along the lines of “go back in there and chill out. The wolf will be there directly.” The distressed character looks astonished. He surprisedly asked his boss, “You’re sending the wolf?” The boss says yes and the character’s tension is released.\nWhen your situation is dire, who’s your wolf? When is crunch time and you need help, who do you call? My relationships are more important than any other items I own now or ever have possessed. Relationships saved my life while comatose in the hospital months ago. Relationships have sustained me physically and financially since February. Relationships can enrich and nourish our mind, body, and spirit. They are vital for our existence. No man is an island unto himself comes to mind.\nMy thoughts are with those friends no longer around. My thoughts are with those who have been kind enough to render aid. My thoughts with those blooming friendships from people I’ve just met in the last week or so. My thoughts are clear. Healthy relationships are needed for survival. \nIf you don’t have these types of relationships now, I’d suggest beginning to develop some. The more success you have, the more relationship opportunities will present themselves. All will not be productive. All will not be beneficial. You’ll have to become adept at determining who wants to be around you and who wants to be around you for what you possess monetarily. Your circle will likely become smaller over time, mine has. But those long standing relationships that have lasted for years or decades, those people will be your wolf. If you’re lucky, like I consider myself, you’ll have an entire wolf pack. More than a handful, perhaps a dozen or more willing to render aid, comfort, and encouragement and help you heal your mind, body, and spirit when it’s most challenging.\nToday, Thursday, July 4, 2024, I am grateful that:\nMy wolf pack is large. I’ve been quite fortunate enough to be grow and develop relationships with like minded people for several decades. We become adults together and our friendships are strong and only getting stronger.\nThe newness of my place hasn’t worn off yet. In fact, instead of wearing off my surroundings have become familiar, but the strata has not. I am enjoying being in this location, but this particular level seems to be something I’m quite unfamiliar with and not used to in the least bit. \nWhen it’s tough or when my life was in peril, I had a team of individuals that rallied. The fended for me when I couldn’t fend for myself. They did any and every single thing needed to ensure my survival. Those are the types of relationships needed to survive and thrive.\nIdentify your wolf pack.\nCall each one and subtly asked how you can serve them? What do they desire? What do they need at this moment?\nWork towards helping them acquire those things.\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "Willing and Able",
        "content": "Willing and Able\nSeveral weeks ago and maybe a bit longer, I heard a speaker sharing a story from the Bible. Two guys were going to be burnt alive by the king and one of them told the king something along the lines of, “If you throw us into the furnace, we serve a God that is able and willing to deliver us from its flame.” Now, I don’t typically quote Bible verses or tell Bible stories, mostly because I’m not a Bible scholar and I don’t like talking or writing about things I don’t know well. This story delivers a message that’s been resonating with me for weeks now. \nLast week I’d written about the turning point and point of safe return. This writing is more about faith and beyond faith, resolve. And more than resolve, it’s conviction, which is a firmly held belief or opinion. The origin is Latin and meant “to overcome decisively.” How about that etymology? To overcome decisively, coupled with belief in you’re serving something “willing and able” to see you through. We’ll just let that marinate for a second. Think about that would you?\nWhen I struggle with belief, with conviction, of Him and His ability to get me where He wants me to go, I have to recall past triumphs. Not my victories, but what He has done, when I get out of the way! I struggle to recall, at times, the significance of His power. I struggle at times to recall His grace. Days like today and the last week or so, those are the times I struggle. I become uninspired, laxed, lazy, and complacent. I don’t move with certainty, or rather, conviction. These are the days to remember.\nI must remember what has happened. I must recall the victories, big and small. From surviving a nearly fatal accident this year. To the paying of my hospital bills, while I was in a coma. To living in another country with no money for over five years. To burying two parents, two older brothers, and two best friends. I must remember bouncing back after countless jobs and multiple careers. I must remember through all of these ups and downs, gains and losses, He has carried me through. Just like the poem, Footprints, “It was then in your times of trial and suffering, when you see one set of footprints. It was then that I carried you.” \nI serve a Creator that’s willing and able. I have been serving and I will continue to serve. When it’s easy, when it’s hard, I will serve. I will ask for help and I will receive more than I need. I will continue to live, thrive, and fulfill my purpose for being on this planet, at this time. I will do what I was created to do. \nToday, Wednesday, September 4, 2024, I am grateful that:\nI got a chance to talk to Gary briefly today. He was on the other line at work and we didn’t talk long. It’s great to have long standing relationships with people. The older I get, the more important those relationships become.\nI got a chance to talk to Grady. We spoke about the roofing business. His ex-wife and a friend of mine recently died. So I wanted to make sure he was doing okay and he was. \nI’m remembering what my Creator has done and is still doing. His grace is something that’s too easily overlooked and I’m happy the days I can recall. I’m a walking testament, but some days it’s shameful. I have to recall and live as if I remember. Today, I’m happy I remembered.\nHow often do you commune with your Creator?\nDo you live with purpose?\nDo you live with conviction?\nIf not, how can you?\nDo one of those things you just thought about today!!!\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "You Can Run, But You Can’t Hide",
        "content": "You Can Run, But You Can’t Hide\nFor the longest time I’ve run from my destiny. I’m like Forrest Gump at times, but in the opposite direction. Destiny is defined several ways, but one of them is a predetermined course of events often held to be an irresistible power or agency. That’s a bunch to type at 5 a.m. so let’s try fate. That’s basically from the French, but originally from the Latin to “make firm or establish.” That’s something I’d never read or heard before. \nI’d always thought of it as fate. Now when I do a quick search and check the origins, the word takes on a more profound and impactful meaning. It’s more significant, yet if you’re like me, you’ve adapted the current definition and lived with it, not how the word was originally intended, in most cases. I grew up in an era when we went to the library. We used the Dewey Decimal system. The only thing digital was the microfilm, everything else was printed. It took longer to get information, but the information rarely changed. \nToday a decent internet connection is all that’s needed. The information is there if you know how to ask and where to look. It’s the same from growing up, only a bit more accessible. It’s not the information, but rather it’s application. Applied knowledge is power. Without the proper application, all the knowledge avails little. You can run from your destiny, but you can’t hide. To make firm or establish your path is one thing, but to start and continue the journey is something entirely different. \nI’ve run and hid from my reason for being created. It’s part of my history, not my present. At first it was ignorance. I didn’t know what I didn’t know or the first stage in learning, Unconscious Incompetence. I believe this assessment of Conscious Competence is my current level. I know what to do, but it takes effort or concentration, it’s Conscious Competence. The final stage is Unconscious Competence. Doing it requires no mental effort at all, you’re basically on autopilot. Like tying your shoelaces. \nThe sooner you begin, the faster you’ll arrive. You can avoid or run from it, but you, nor I can hide. Ignorance is acceptable, until you’re granted awareness. Afterwards, your learning leads to mastery. \nToday, Thursday, July 11, 2024, I am grateful that:\nWith the assistance of a dear friend, I was able to get some things done. It’s been a tough go of it lately, but the kindness and generosity has aided my journey in ways too numerous to write about this morning.\nI had the chance to pick up a few groceries and some other needed items for the new place. I’m thinking almost everything is done and when Moe pops by later today, I’ll get a second opinion I respect and trust.\nI got a chance to hang out with Cess. We met by happenstance while I was shopping. She appeared to be easy enough to get along with and we’ll see what, if anything, develops. \nAre you running from your destiny?\nAre you hiding from it well?\nIf not, list three reasons you continue towards your destination.\nIf you’re running, write three possibilities or benefits you received if you moved towards your destination compared to what you’re currently doing.\nAbe, \nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "You’ll Never Get Where You’re Going…",
        "content": "You’ll Never Get Where You’re Going…\nIn the mid 1990s, I joined a Network Marketing company. It was after about five years at one of the largest retail stores in the country and I was in my mid twenties. We’d had a recruiting event in Houston and I wanted to see some of my Dad’s family since I was so close. I drove to Beaumont and got a chance to hang out and fellowship with cousins, aunts, and uncles. \nI’m thinking it was the first time I’d visited my Uncle Frank and Aunt Martha Jo’s new house. I wasn’t entirely sure how to get back the highway and she happily showed me the way. As we neared the highway, she pulled into a gas station. I don’t recall the entire conversation, but I do recall her wisdom. “You’ll never get where you’re going, if you keep starting over.”\nIf I’d heeded those words, my entire life would have been different. I would’ve trudged along in that Network Marketing company, unable to recruit, but easily selling products. I would never have gotten licensed to sell Life Insurance, which led to over a decade in the Financial Services industry. I surely wouldn’t have gotten burnt out and taken a year off to self evaluate. I would not have sold cars, nor would have met one of my mentors. Herb. \nI’ve stated, matter of factly, on multiple occasions that I’ve had more careers than most people have had jobs. It’s not something I say with pride nor shame, it’s merely a statement of fact. Writing, creating, as I’ve done for more than seven years now is the longest I’ve stuck with anything. It’s the manifestation of my aunt’s words of wisdom so many years ago. \nI’ve written a vast array of content, from articles, to study courses, novellas, novels, resumes, pitch decks, and so much more. I find it relaxing. I find it fulfilling. I find it permanent. Digitally words can change, but once ink dries on paper, well that’s about as permanent as it gets. These last years writing wouldn’t be considered a waste if I started another career, but it would lengthen the time needed to get to where I’m going.\nToday, Monday, January 29, 2024, I am grateful that: \nThe weekend was relaxing. Got a chance to hang with Sherman for a bit. He swung through and bailed me out of a tough spot. He couldn’t stay long, but it was good to see him, even if for a short time.\nI got a chance to do some work for Diana. She’s facing a deadline and after not having clarity for a bit, she definitely has some now. Happy I could be of service. \nI was able to speak with Ann and Nick this weekend. Two separate conversations and both were enjoyable. It’s great to have friends that are locals. \nHow do you determine when it’s time to switch?\nDo you stick to things longer than you know you should?\nWhat do you say to yourself to keep going?\nWho do you talk to before you quit?\nAbe, \nBe Greater!!!"

        "title": "…Checking It Twice…",
        "content": "…Checking It Twice…\nThis morning as I’m thinking of a title, wind from my fan blows the lists I’ve taped to my wall. These lists have all the action items I’ll get finished this month. The lyrics from Santa Claus Is Coming To Town popped into mind. “He’s making a list and checking it twice, gonna find out who’s naughty and nice” and so it goes. I’ve made my list. I’ve checked it more than twice. I’ve been naughty and not so nice. \nMy last spiritual advisor and I would talk on my way to the office years ago. Monday through Friday we’d end our calls with him saying, “Give ‘em your best Big Man” or “Give ‘em a 110%.” Either way his message conveyed the same thing, do your best today. I can say over the last few days, maybe longer, I’ve done something but it wasn’t my best.\nOne of the greatest benefits of reflection is discovering deficiencies. As I type this list in the mornings I get to contemplate what I’m doing, what I planned, and what I’ve done. If it’s not going to plan, I can change. If it’s not going as well as I’d like or plan, I can change. When I’m not doing my best, I can and usually do write about it and change. Hence the reason for writing about it today. I can do some thing a bit better. I can put in more effort. I can get a few more things finished. I can setup or implement another process or system. I can pack more into the stream of life. I hadn’t been doing that as much as I’ve done in the past. I’d gotten a bit comfortable and that’s a failure on my part. \nSome may say or think to themselves, “Well you did something and that’s commendable” and I agree. The point of my life at this point isn’t about doing something, it’s about being impactful. In order to have a ‘strong effect on someone or something’ just doing something isn’t enough. A strong anything requires more than a casual doing or going through the motions. I can’t be impactful going through the motions. I must move with intention, with force, better yet, deliberately. \nIf I had to offer a grade and assess my past performances this month, I’d be happy with a “D” but I’m sure it’s more like an “F” and that’s being honest. I could say I’m doing what the average person does and that may be true, but I’m not average. I’ve never been average. No one really is average, but we fall into a curve of mediocrity from lack of passion, purpose, and deliberate action. I possess purpose. I’m relatively passionate and my actions are deliberate. I’d written about increasing intensity a little while ago and that’s the key for this particular challenge I face.  \nToday, Tuesday, August 20, 2024, I am grateful that:\nAlthough it’s late, I’m finishing my list. Everyday isn’t super productive nor my best effort, but most days get some things done.\nI’m willing and able to self assess. Also, having those I can rely on for objective feedback is vital and I have amassed quite a circle of confidants.\nI got everything sent to Herb. Every piece of info he’ll need to make an informed decision. I’m hoping enough info was provided to properly convey the value in the service I’m delivering. I don’t believe I’ve communicated that clearly enough.\nWill you deliver your best today?\nAbe,\nBe Greater!!!"
